The original expression is the inverse of $(2 + \\sqrt{x})^{-1} + 1$.

The second term, 1, can be written as $\\frac{2 + \\sqrt{x}}{2 + \\sqrt{x}}$ because multiplying numerator and denominator by $(2 + \\sqrt{x})$ gives us that.

Both numerator and denominator have a factor of 1, so maybe we can write it as:\n\n$\\frac{2 + \\sqrt{x}}{3 + \\sqrt{x}}$\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to rationalize the denominator? Let's try that.

One of the diagonals of the trapezoid is 8 cm, and the angle between the diagonals is $60^{\\circ}$. Find the perimeter of the trapezoid.\n\n<think>\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\nidraw\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the perimeter of the trapezoid. Let's start by understanding the given information.\n\nFirst, the trapezoid has bases of lengths 3 cm and 5 cm. Let's denote the longer base as 5 cm and the shorter one as 3 cm for simplicity. The diagonals of the trapezoid are 8 cm each, and the angle between them is 60 degrees. Our goal is to find the perimeter, which will be the sum of all sides: 5 cm + 3 cm + 8 cm + 8 cm = 26 cm. However, we need to verify if this approach is correct or if there's a mistake in assuming the longer base.\n\nWait, actually, the problem states \"one of the diagonals\" is 8 cm. Since the bases are 3 and 5 cm, the other diagonal should also be 8 cm? But in a trapezoid, the two diagonals are usually of different lengths unless it's isosceles. However, the problem doesn't specify that the trapezoid is isosceles, so maybe both diagonals are 8 cm. If that's the case, then the perimeter would indeed be 5 + 3 + 8 + 8 = 24 cm. But let's check if this assumption is valid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the other diagonal being 8 cm. Wait, no, the problem says \"one of the diagonals is 8 cm\". So either of the diagonals could be 8 cm. But in a trapezoid, the two diagonals have different lengths. So if one diagonal is 8 cm, the other must be different. Therefore, the perimeter would be 5 + 3 + 8 + 8 = 24 cm. But let's confirm this.\n\nBut wait, maybe the problem is not specifying which diagonal is 8 cm.

Find the perimeter of the trapezoid.\n\n<think>\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\nidraw\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the perimeter of the trapezoid. Let's start by understanding the given information.\n\nFirst, the trapezoid has bases of lengths 3 cm and 5 cm. Let's denote the longer base as 5 cm and the shorter one as 3 cm for simplicity. The diagonals of the trapezoid are 8 cm each, and the angle between them is 60 degrees. Our goal is to find the perimeter, which will be the sum of all sides: 5 cm + 3 cm + 8 cm + 8 cm = 26 cm. However, we need to verify if this approach is correct or if there's a mistake in assuming the longer base.\n\nWait, actually, the problem states \"one of the diagonals\" is 8 cm. Since the bases are 3 and 5 cm, the other diagonal should also be 8 cm? But in a trapezoid, the two diagonals are usually of different lengths unless it's isosceles. However, the problem doesn't specify that the trapezoid is isosceles, so maybe both diagonals are 8 cm. If that's the case, then the perimeter would indeed be 5 + 3 + 8 + 8 = 24 cm. But let's check if this assumption is valid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the other diagonal being 8 cm. Wait, no, the problem says \"one of the diagonals is 8 cm\". So either of the diagonals could be 8 cm. But in a trapezoid, the two diagonals have different lengths. So if one diagonal is 8 cm, the other must be different. Therefore, the perimeter would be 5 + 3 + 8 + 8 = 24 cm. But let's confirm this.\n\nBut wait, maybe the problem is not specifying which diagonal is 8 cm.

Find the perimeter of the trapezoid.\n\nFirst, let's clarify the problem. We have a trapezoid with bases 3 cm and 5 cm. One of its diagonals is 8 cm. The angle between the diagonals is 60 degrees. We need to find the perimeter.\n\nLet me visualize the trapezoid. Let's denote the trapezoid as ABCD, where AB and CD are the bases, with AB = 5 cm and CD = 3 cm. Let’s say diagonal AC is 8 cm, and the angle between diagonals AC and BD is 60 degrees. Alternatively, the other diagonal might be 8 cm. But since the problem states \"one of the diagonals is 8 cm\", we can proceed under that assumption.\n\nIn a trapezoid, the diagonals intersect each other, dividing each other into segments.
