The original expression is:\n\n$$\n\\left(2 + \\sqrt{x}\\right)^{-1} + 1\n$$\n\nFirst, let's handle the inverse of the binomial term. The inverse of $(2 + \\sqrt{x})^{-1}$ is the reciprocal of that term. The reciprocal of a fraction is obtained by flipping the numerator and denominator.

Let me clarify.\n\nIf I have $(a + b)^{-1}$, then its inverse would be $(a + b)$, because applying the inverse function undoes the original function. For example, if you have $f(x) = x + 3$, then the inverse function is $f^{-1}(x) = x - 3$. So, if we have $(f(x))^{-1}$, that would be $f^{-1}(x)$. Therefore, $(a + b)^{-1}$ is the same as $a + b$? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no. Wait, let's take an example.\n\nSuppose $f(x) = x + 3$, so $f^{-1}(x) = x - 3$. Then, $(f(x))^{-1} = f^{-1}(x) = x - 3$. But $f(x) = x + 3$, so $(f(x))^{-1} = x - 3$, which is equal to $f^{-1}(x)$. So, in general, $(a + b)^{-1} = a + b$. Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, but if we have $(a + b)^{-1}$, then multiplying it by $(a + b)$ gives 1. So, $(a + b)^{-1} * (a + b) = 1$. Therefore, $(a + b)^{-1} = 1/(a + b)$. Therefore, $(a + b)^{-1}$ is equal to $1/(a + b)$. Therefore, in this case, $(2 + \\sqrt{x})^{-1} = 1/(2 + \\sqrt{x})$.

We need to find the greatest integer n such that there do not exist positive integers a and b satisfying n = 7a + 5b. This type of problem is related to the Frobenius number, which is the largest monetary amount that cannot be obtained using any combination of coins of specified denominations. In this case, the denominations are 7 and 5 cents. However, it's important to note that the Frobenius number for two coprime denominations m and n is given by mn - m - n. For example, if m and n are coprime, the largest number that cannot be expressed as a linear combination of m and n is 35 (7*5 - 7 -5). But in this problem, the answer choices include 82, 47, 45, 42, and None. Since 35 is one of the options (C), but the answer isn't 35 here. Therefore, the problem is not about two coprime denominations, so the standard Frobenius formula doesn't apply directly.\n\nTo approach this problem, we can use the concept of the greatest integer that cannot be expressed as a linear combination of two coprime numbers. However, since 7 and 5 are not coprime (their GCD is 1, but they share a common divisor of 1), we need a different method. One approach is to check numbers sequentially and see which ones cannot be expressed as 7a + 5b. Alternatively, we can use the concept of the Chicken McNugget theorem, which states that for two coprime integers m and n, the largest number that cannot be expressed as a linear combination of m and n is mn - m - n. However, since 7 and 5 are not coprime, this formula does not apply directly. Therefore, we need another strategy.\n\nOne method to solve such problems is to consider the possible remainders when n is divided by the smaller denomination. Since 5 is smaller than 7, we can look at n modulo 5. Let's analyze possible residues of n modulo 5.

Let's consider triangle $A B C$ and triangle $C D A$. In these triangles, we can apply the Law of Cosines if we know all three sides or two sides and the included angle.

We need to find the angles of the triangle.\n\nFirst, let's recall some basic properties of triangles and altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side. The length of the altitude is related to the area of the triangle: if h_a is the altitude corresponding to side a, then the area (A) is (1/2)*a*h_a.\n\nGiven that two altitudes are not smaller than the sides to which they are dropped. Let's denote the triangle as ABC, with sides a, b, c opposite to angles A, B, C respectively. Then, the altitudes correspond to these sides would be h_a, h_b, h_c. The problem states that at least two of these altitudes are not smaller than the corresponding sides. So, either h_a ≥ a or h_b ≥ b, or h_c ≥ c.\n\nOur goal is to find the angles of such a triangle. Let's consider different cases where two altitudes are not smaller than their respective sides.\n\nCase 1: Suppose h_a ≥ a and h_b ≥ b. Then, since h_a = 2Δ / a and Δ is the area, we have 2Δ / a ≥ a ⇒ 2Δ ≥ a² ⇒ Δ ≥ a²/2. Similarly, h_b = 2Δ / b ≥ b ⇒ 2Δ ≥ b² ⇒ Δ ≥ b²/2. But Δ is the same for both, so Δ ≥ max(a²/2, b²/2). However, since Δ is also equal to (1/2)*a*h_a = (1/2)*b*h_b, perhaps we can relate a and b through this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to express the sides in terms of altitudes. For example, if h_a ≥ a, then h_a² ≥ a² ⇒ 2Δ ≥ a³ ⇒ Δ ≥ a³/2. Similarly, h_b² ≥ b² ⇒ Δ ≥ b³/2. Since Δ is the same, Δ ≥ max(a³/2, b³/2). But again, Δ is (1/2)*a*h_a = (1/2)*b*h_b, so substituting h_b = 2Δ / b into h_b² ≥ b² gives (4Δ²)/b² ≥ b² ⇒ 4Δ² ≥ b⁴ ⇒ Δ ≥ b²/2. Similarly, h_a² ≥ a² ⇒ (4Δ²)/a² ≥ a² ⇒ 4Δ² ≥ a⁴ ⇒ Δ ≥ a²/2. Therefore, combining these, Δ ≥ max(a²/2, b²/2). But since Δ is the same, we must have a²/2 ≤ b²/2 ⇒ a ≤ b, or similarly b²/2 ≤ a²/2 ⇒ b ≤ a. So, in this case, sides a and b satisfy a ≤ b. Similarly, in Case 2 where h_b ≥ b and h_c ≥ c, we might get b ≤ c. But let's see if there's another possibility.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of considering each case separately, we can use the relation between the sides and altitudes. Let's note that in any triangle, the product of a side and its corresponding altitude is equal to twice the area. So, for example, a*h_a = 2Δ, b*h_b = 2Δ, c*h_c = 2Δ.
