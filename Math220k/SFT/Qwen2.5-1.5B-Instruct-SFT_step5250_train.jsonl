The Frobenius problem seeks the largest monetary amount that cannot be obtained using any combination of coins of specified denominations. For two coin denominations, the formula for the largest non-representable number is (m*n - m - n), where m and n are the denominations. However, this formula works when m and n are coprime. In our case, the denominations are 7 and 5. Are they coprime? Let's check: gcd(7,5) = 1, since 7 is prime and doesn't divide 5. So yes, they are coprime.
