The Law of Cosines relates the lengths of the sides of a triangle to the cosine of one of its angles. Hmm, but the problem mentions a trapezoid, which is a quadrilateral with one pair of parallel sides. So maybe I need to figure out the lengths of the other two sides of the trapezoid first. Let me visualize the trapezoid. The bases are 3 cm and 5 cm, so those are the two parallel sides. The diagonals are 8 cm each, and the angle between them is 60 degrees. Since it's a trapezoid, the diagonals intersect each other, forming two triangles. Maybe I can use the Law of Cosines in one of those triangles to find the other sides.\n\nLet me label the trapezoid. Let's call the trapezoid ABCD, with AB and CD as the bases, where AB is 3 cm and CD is 5 cm. Let me assume that AB is the shorter base (3 cm) and CD is the longer base (5 cm). The diagonals are AC and BD, each 8 cm. The angle between them is 60 degrees. So, the angle between AC and BD is 60 degrees. Since the diagonals intersect each other, they form two triangles: ABD and BCD. I need to find the lengths of sides AD and BC.\n\nFirst, let me consider triangle ABD. In triangle ABD, sides AB = 3 cm, BD = 8 cm, and angle at B is 60 degrees. I can use the Law of Cosines here to find side AD. The Law of Cosines states that c² = a² + b² - 2ab cos(C), where C is the angle between sides a and b. So, in triangle ABD:\n\nAD² = AB² + BD² - 2 * AB * BD * cos(angle at B)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nAD² = 3² + 8² - 2 * 3 * 8 * cos(60°)\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n3² = 9\n\n8² = 64\n\ncos(60°) = 0.5\n\nSo:\n\nAD² = 9 + 64 - 2 * 3 * 8 * 0.5\n\nAD² = 73 - 2 * 3 * 8 * 0.5\n\nAD² = 73 - 24\n\nAD² = 49\n\nTherefore, AD = √49 = 7 cm.\n\nSimilarly, in triangle BCD, sides BC = 5 cm, BD = 8 cm, and angle at B is 60 degrees. Let me find side BC using the Law of Cosines again.\n\nBC² = BD² + BC² - 2 * BD * BC * cos(angle at B)\n\nBut in this case, angle at B is 60 degrees, so cos(60°) = 0.5. So:\n\nBC² = 8² + BC² - 2 * 8 * BC * 0.5\n\nSimplifying:\n\nBC² = 64 + BC² - 8 * BC\n\nSubtract BC² from both sides:\n\n0 = 64 - 8 * BC\n\nSo:\n\n8 * BC = 64\n\nBC = 64 / 8 = 8 cm.\n\nSo,\n\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant that provides well‑reasoned but short responses.\nYou first briefly think about the reasoning process as an internal monologue and then provide the user with the answer.\nRespond in the following format:\n\nProblem: The Law of Cosines\n\nThe bases of a trapezoid are 3 cm and 5 cm. One of the diagonals of the trapezoid is 8 cm, and the angle between the diagonals is $60^{\\circ}$. Find the perimeter of the trapezoid.\n\n<think>\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\n<think>\nAlright, so I need to find the perimeter of this trapezoid. Let me start by recalling the Law of Cosines. The Law of Cosines relates the lengths of the sides of a triangle to the cosine of one of its angles. Hmm, but the problem mentions a trapezoid, which is a quadrilateral with one pair of parallel sides. So maybe I need to figure out the lengths of the other two sides of the trapezoid first. Let me visualize the trapezoid. The bases are 3 cm and 5 cm, so those are the two parallel sides. The diagonals are 8 cm each, and the angle between them is 60 degrees. Since it's a trapezoid, the diagonals intersect each other, forming two triangles. Maybe I can use the Law of Cosines in one of those triangles to find the other sides.\n\nLet me label the trapezoid. Let's call the trapezoid ABCD, with AB and CD as the bases, where AB is 3 cm and CD is 5 cm. Let me assume that AB is the shorter base (3 cm) and CD is the longer base (5 cm). The diagonals are AC and BD, each 8 cm. The angle between them is 60 degrees. So, the angle between AC and BD is 60 degrees. Since the diagonals intersect each other, they form two triangles: ABD and BCD. I need to find the lengths of sides AD and BC.\n\nFirst, let me consider triangle ABD. In triangle ABD, sides AB = 3 cm, BD = 8 cm, and angle at B is 60 degrees. I can use the Law of Cosines here to find side AD. The Law of Cosines states that c² = a² + b² - 2ab cos(C), where C is the angle between sides a and b. So, in triangle ABD:\n\nAD² = AB² + BD² - 2 * AB * BD * cos(angle at B)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nAD² = 3² + 8² - 2 * 3 * 8 * cos(60°)\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n3² = 9\n\n8² = 64\n\ncos(60°) = 0.5\n\nSo:\n\nAD² = 9 + 64 - 2 * 3 * 8 * 0.5\n\nAD² = 73 - 2 * 3 * 8 * 0.5\n\nAD² = 73 - 24\n\nAD² = 49\n\nTherefore, AD = √49 = 7 cm.\n\nSimilarly, in triangle BCD, sides BC = 5 cm, BD = 8 cm, and angle at B is 60 degrees. Let me find side BC using the Law of Cosines again.\n\nBC² = BD² + BC² - 2 * BD * BC * cos(angle at B)\n\nBut in this case, angle at B is 60 degrees, so cos(60°) = 0.5. So:\n\nBC² = 8² + BC² - 2 * 8 * BC * 0.5\n\nSimplifying:\n\nBC² = 64 + BC² - 8 * BC\n\nSubtract BC² from both sides:\n\n0 = 64 - 8 * BC\n\nSo:\n\n8 * BC = 64\n\nBC = 64 / 8 = 8 cm.\n\nSo,\n\n<answer>\nThe perimeter of the trapezoid is the sum of all its sides: AB + BC + CD + DA. Let's calculate that:\n\nAB = 3 cm\n\nBC = 8 cm\n\nCD = 5 cm\n\nDA = 7 cm\n\nSo perimeter = 3 + 8 + 5 + 7 = 23 cm.\n\nTherefore, the perimeter of the trapezoid is 23 cm.\n</answer>You are a helpful AI assistant.

Let me check if I'm understanding the problem correctly.\n\nThe problem states: \"For {1,2,3,..., n} and each of its non-empty subsets, we define the \"alternating sum\" as follows: arrange the numbers in the subset in decreasing order, then alternately add and subtract the numbers starting from the largest (for example, the alternating sum of {1,2,4,6,9} is 9 - 6 + 4 - 2 + 1 = 6, and the alternating sum of {5} is 5). For n=7, find the total of all these alternating sums.\"\n\nSo, for n=7, the set is {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}. Each non-empty subset has an alternating sum. The total of all these sums is what we need to find. The total sum of all subsets is 2^7 = 128. The empty set's sum is 0. So, total alternating sums = 128 - 0 = 128. But that seems too straightforward. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for the alternating sum of all subsets. For a set with n elements, the total sum of all subsets is 2^n. The alternating sum of all subsets can be calculated by considering the sum of all subsets with even number of elements and subtracting the sum of all subsets with odd number of elements. However, this might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe there's a combinatorial argument.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a recursive formula. Let's denote S(n) as the total of all alternating sums for a set of n elements. Then, S(n) = S(n-1) + S(n-1) - S(n-2), where S(n-1) is the total of all subsets of n-1 elements, and S(n-2) is the total of all subsets of n-2 elements. This is similar to the formula for the sum of all subsets, but with alternating signs. So, S(n) = 2S(n-1) - S(n-2). But this is a recurrence relation. Let's solve it.\n\nFirst, base cases: S(0) = 0 (since there are no subsets), S(1) = 1\n\n<answer>\nThe total of all alternating sums for n=7 is 128. This is because the total sum of all subsets is 2^7 = 128, and the alternating sum of the empty set is 0. Therefore, the total alternating sum is 128 - 0 = 128. The reasoning is that each subset contributes to the total sum, and the alternating sum of each subset is added or subtracted depending on its position in the total sum. Since the empty set's contribution is 0, the total is just the sum of all subsets. The formula S(n) = 2S(n-1) - S(n-2) is a recurrence relation that can be used to compute S(n) for any n, but for n=7, the answer is 128.\n</answer>You are a helpful AI assistant.

Find the area of the part of the triangle that is outside these circles.\n\n<think>\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\nLet me think about this problem. First, I need to visualize an equilateral triangle with side length a. Inside this triangle, there are three equal circles, each touching two sides of the triangle and two other circles. The question is asking for the area of the part of the triangle that is outside these circles. Hmm, so the circles are arranged in such a way that each touches two sides of the triangle and two other circles. That sounds like a Descartes' Circle Theorem problem, but I need to confirm.\n\nDescartes' Circle Theorem relates the curvatures of four mutually tangent circles. The theorem states that for four mutually tangent circles with curvatures k1, k2, k3, k4, the following equation holds:\n\n(k1 + k2 + k3 + k4)^2 = 2(k1^2 + k2^2 + k3^2 + k4^2)\n\nIn this problem, the circles are arranged in a triangular pattern. Let me try to model this.\n\nFirst, let's consider the equilateral triangle. The area of an equilateral triangle with side length a is (sqrt(3)/4)a². The problem mentions three equal circles, each touching two sides of the triangle and two other circles. So, each circle is tangent to two sides and two other circles. This suggests that the circles are arranged in a triangular pattern, with each circle touching two sides and two others.\n\nGiven that the circles are equal and each touches two sides of the triangle, the centers of the circles must lie on the altitude of the triangle. This is because the altitude of an equilateral triangle divides it into two 30-60-90 triangles, and the altitude is also the radius of the circles. Let me confirm this.\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, the altitude (h) can be calculated as (sqrt(3)/2)a. So, each circle has a radius of (sqrt(3)/2)a. Since the circles are equal, each has a radius of (sqrt(3)/2)a. The centers of the circles must lie on the altitude of the triangle. Let me confirm this.\n\nIf each circle is tangent to two sides of the triangle, then the distance from the center of each circle to the sides of the triangle is equal to the radius of the circle. Since the triangle is equilateral, the altitude is the distance from a vertex to the opposite side. The altitude of the triangle is (sqrt(3)/2)a. Therefore, the centers of the circles must lie on this altitude. Each circle is tangent to two sides, so the distance from the center to each side is equal to the radius. Therefore, the centers of the circles are located at a distance of (sqrt(3)/2)a from each side of the triangle.\n\nNow, the problem states that each circle touches two other circles. So, the centers of the circles must be arranged in a triangular pattern. Let me try to model this.\n\nIf each circle is tangent to two sides and two other circles, then the centers of the circles must form a triangular pattern. Let me try to visualize this.\n\nSuppose we have three circles, each tangent to two sides of the triangle and two other circles. Let me denote the centers of the circles as A, B, and C. Since each circle is tangent to two sides of the triangle, the centers A, B, and C must lie on the altitude of the triangle.

Let me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, the area of the equilateral triangle with side length a is (sqrt(3)/4)a². The problem mentions three equal circles, each with radius (sqrt(3)/2)a. Each circle is tangent to two sides of the triangle and two other circles. The centers of the circles must lie on the altitude of the triangle, which is (sqrt(3)/2)a. Therefore, the distance from each center to the sides is (sqrt(3)/2)a.\n\nThe area of the part of the triangle that is outside these circles is the area of the triangle minus the area of the three circles. The area of each circle is π*(sqrt(3)/2)^2 = π*(3/4) = (3π)/4. Therefore, the total area of the three circles is 3*(3π)/4 = (9π)/4.\n\nSo, the area of the part of the triangle that is outside these circles is (sqrt(3)/", "e71c071_correct": false}

Since Anya gives half of her mushrooms to Vitya, she gives (A / 2) mushrooms to Vitya. Therefore, the number of mushrooms Anya has left is A - (A / 2) = A / 2. The number of mushrooms Vitya has is (A / 2) + X. The remaining mushrooms are C * X - (A / 2) - (A / 2) = C * X - A. Since all children have the same number of mushrooms after the transfer, the remaining mushrooms must be evenly distributed among the C children. Therefore, the remaining mushrooms can be divided equally among the C children, so each child has (C * X - A) / C = X - A / C. But since all children have the same number, this must equal X. Therefore, we have:\n\nX = (C * X - A) / C\n\nMultiplying both sides by C:\n\nC * X = C * X - A\n\nSubtracting C * X from both sides:\n\n0 = -A\n\nTherefore, A = 0. Wait, that can't be right.

We need to find the real number a such that this equation has three real roots that form an arithmetic sequence. Hmm, let's recall that for a cubic equation with real coefficients, if the roots form an arithmetic sequence, then the middle root is the average of the other two. Let me denote the roots as r - d, r, r + d. Since they form an arithmetic sequence, the middle root is r. So, the roots are r - d, r, r + d. Let me write the equation in terms of these roots.\n\nThe sum of the roots of a cubic equation is equal to the negation of the coefficient of x² divided by the leading coefficient. So, the sum of the roots is -(3) = -3. Therefore, (r - d) + r + (r + d) = 3r = -3. Solving for r, we get r = -1.

We need to find the real number a such that this equation has three real roots that form an arithmetic sequence. Hmm, let's recall that for a cubic equation with real coefficients, if the roots form an arithmetic sequence, then the middle root is the average of the other two. Let me denote the roots as r - d, r, r + d. Since they form an arithmetic sequence, the middle root is r. So, the roots are r - d, r, r + d. Let me write the equation in terms of these roots.\n\nThe sum of the roots of a cubic equation is equal to the negation of the coefficient of x² divided by the leading coefficient. So, the sum of the roots is -(3) = -3. Therefore, (r - d) + r + (r + d) = 3r = -3. Solving for r, we get r = -1. So, the roots are -1 - d, -1, -1 + d.\n\nNow, let's write the cubic equation in terms of these roots. The cubic equation can be written as (x - (-1 - d))(x - (-1))(x - (-1 + d)) = 0.

The equation given is x³ + 3x² - x + a = 0. We need to find the real number a such that this cubic equation has three real roots that form an arithmetic sequence. Hmm, let's start by recalling that for a cubic equation with real coefficients, if the roots form an arithmetic sequence, then the middle root is the average of the other two. That makes sense because in an arithmetic sequence, the middle term is the average of the first and last terms. So, if the roots are r - d, r, r + d, then the middle root is r, which is the average of (r - d) and (r + d). Therefore, r = (r - d + r + d)/2 = r. That's correct. So, the roots are r - d, r, r + d.

For the first function, f(x) = x³ - 5x² + 2x + 4, as x approaches -3, I need to find the limit. Since it's a polynomial function, I can simply substitute x = -3 into the function. That seems straightforward. Let me check that.\n\nSubstituting x = -3 into f(x):\n\nf(-3) = (-3)³ - 5*(-3)² + 2*(-3) + 4\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n(-3)³ = -27\n\n5*(-3)² = 5*9 = 45\n\n2*(-3) = -6\n\nAdding them up:\n\n-27 + 45 -6 +4 = (45 -27) + (-6 +4) = 18 -2 = 16\n\nSo the limit as x approaches -3 is 16.

To find the limit, I need to analyze the behavior of each part as t approaches 6.\n\nFirst, let's consider the term t√(t² - 20). As t approaches 6, t is approaching 6, so t² - 20 approaches 36 - 20 = 16. Therefore, √(t² - 20) approaches √16 = 4. So, t√(t² - 20) approaches 6*4 = 24. Therefore, the first term t√(t² - 20) approaches 24.\n\nNext, the second term is -log(t + √(t² - 20)). Let's analyze the argument of the logarithm, which is t + √(t² - 20). As t approaches 6, t is 6, so √(t² - 20) is 4, so t + √(t² - 20) is 6 + 4 = 10. Therefore, the logarithm is log(10). The logarithm of 10 is 1, so the second term approaches -1.\n\nTherefore, the entire function φ(t) approaches 24 - 1 = 23 as t approaches 6. So the limit is 23.\n\nTherefore, the answers are:\n\n1) The limit of f(x) as x approaches -3 is 16.\n\n2) The limit of φ(t) as t approaches 6 is 23.\n\n</answer>\n\nTherefore, the answers are:\n\n1) 16\n\n2) 23\n\nThe first function is a polynomial, so the limit is straightforward.

Therefore, the first term t√(t² - 20) approaches 24.\n\nNext, the second term is -log(t + √(t² - 20)). Let's analyze the argument of the logarithm, which is t + √(t² - 20). As t approaches 6, t is 6, so √(t² - 20) is 4, so t + √(t² - 20) is 6 + 4 = 10. Therefore, the logarithm is log(10). The logarithm of 10 is 1, so the second term approaches -1.\n\nTherefore, the entire function φ(t) approaches 24 - 1 = 23 as t approaches 6.

Let's recall that when dealing with limits involving logarithms and square roots, sometimes L'Hospital's Rule can be applied. However, since the function is a combination of a square root and a logarithm, it's important to check if the conditions for L'Hospital's Rule are met.\n\nFirst, let's check the continuity of the function at t = 6. The function is composed of two parts: t√(t² - 20) and -log(t + √(t² - 20)). Let's analyze each part separately.\n\nFor the first part, t√(t² - 20). As t approaches 6, t is approaching 6, so t² - 20 approaches 36 - 20 = 16. Therefore, √(t² - 20) approaches √16 = 4. So, t√(t² - 20) approaches 6*4 = 2", "e71c071_correct": true}

Hmm, let's see. I remember that when you have a polynomial that's a cube of a binomial, it's something like (a - b)^3 = a^3 - 3a^2b + 3ab^2 - b^3. But in this case, the given polynomial is a bit different. Let me check if it's a binomial cubed. Let's see: the coefficients are 1, -6, 15, -20, 15, -6, 1. The first term is x^6, which is a^3, so a must be x. Then the coefficient of x^5 is -6, which is -3a^2b. So -3a^2b = -6x^5. Therefore, a^2b = 2x^5. Similarly, the coefficient of x^4 is 15, which is 3ab^2. So 3ab^2 = 15x^4. Let me write that as 3ab^2 = 15x^4. Then, the coefficient of x^3 is -20, which is -3a^3b. So -3a^3b = -20x^3. Let me check if this makes sense. If a is x, then a^3 is x^3, so -3a^3b = -3x^3b = -20x^3. Therefore, -3x^3b = -20x^3. Dividing both sides by -3x^3 gives b = 20/3. Then, substituting back into 3ab^2 = 15x^4. So 3x*(20/3)^2 = 15x^4. Let me compute (20/3)^2: 400/9. Then 3x*(400/9) = 1200x/9 = 400x/3. So 400x/3 = 15x^4. Therefore, 400x/3 = 15x^4. Let me check if this is correct. If 400x/3 = 15x^4, then multiplying both sides by 3/400 gives x^4 = 15x^4/3/400 = 15/3/400 = 5/400 = 1/80. So x^4 = 1/80, which is not equal to x^4. Wait, that seems wrong. Let me check again. If 400x/3 = 15x^4, then 400x = 45x^4. Dividing both sides by x gives 400 = 45x^3. So x^3 = 400/45 = 80/9. Then x = (80/9)^(1/3).

Then equation (2) is f(g(y)) = y f(1) + 1.\n\nNow, let's consider equation (1) again. Let's set y = 1 in equation (1). Then we have f(x f(x + 1)) = f(x) + 1. But from equation (2), we have f(g(1)) = f(1) + 1. So if we let z = 1, then f(g(z)) = f(1) + 1. But g(z) = f(1 + z), so f(f(1 + z)) = f(1) + 1. But from equation (1), f(x f(x + 1)) = f(x) + 1. So if we set x = 1, then f(f(1 + z)) = f(1) + 1. Therefore, f(f(1 + z)) = f(1) + 1. So this suggests that f is a function such that f applied to itself at some point is equal to f(1) + 1. Maybe this is a key property.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can set x = 1 in equation (1). Then f(f(1 + y)) = f(1) + 1. But from equation (2), f(g(y)) = y f(1) + 1. So if we set y = 1, then f(g(1)) = f(1) + 1. So f(f(1 + 1)) = f(1) + 1, which is f(2) = f(1) + 1. So f(2) = f(1) + 1.\n\nSimilarly, if we set y = 2 in equation (2), then f(g(2)) = 2 f(1) + 1. But from equation (1), f(f(1 +\n\n<answer>\nThe problem is to find all functions \\( f: \\mathbb{R}^{+} \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{+} \\) such that \\( f(x f(x + y)) = y f(x) + 1 \\) for all \\( x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+} \\).\n\nFirst, let's try plugging in specific values for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). Let's start with \\( y = 1 \\). Then the equation becomes \\( f(x f(x + 1)) = f(x) + 1 \\). Let's denote this as equation (1): \\( f(x f(x + 1)) = f(x) + 1 \\).\n\nNext, set \\( x = 1 \\). Then the equation becomes \\( f(f(1 + y)) = y f(1) + 1 \\). Let's denote this as equation (2): \\( f(f(1 + y)) = y f(1) + 1 \\).\n\nNow, let's set \\( y = 1 \\) in equation (2).

The problem states that the parabola C is y = (1/2)x², and the circle D is x² + (y - 1/2)² = r² with r > 0. The circles and parabola have no common points, so the circles don't intersect the parabola. Then, a tangent line is drawn from point A on the parabola to the circle, touching at points E and F.

Let me start by recalling what Euler's totient function is. It's the number of integers up to n that are coprime to n. So, φ(n) counts how many numbers from 1 to n are relatively prime to n. The problem is asking for n where this sum is exactly (3n² + 5)/8. Hmm, interesting. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that φ(n) is multiplicative, meaning that if n = p₁^a₁ * p₂^a₂ * ... * p_k^a_k, then φ(n) = n * (1 - 1/p₁)(1 - 1/p₂)...(1 - 1/p_k). So, maybe I can express the sum as a product of φ(k) terms. But the sum is from k=1 to n, so maybe I can write it as a product over all primes p and their exponents a, where φ(p^a) = p^a - p^{a-1}. But wait, φ(p^a) is p^a - p^{a-1}, so φ(p^a) = p^{a-1}(p - 1). Therefore, the sum would be a product over all primes p and their exponents a, multiplied by p^{a-1}(p - 1). But since the sum is from k=1 to n, which is the product over all primes p and their exponents a, multiplied by p^{a-1}(p - 1). So, the sum is equal to (p - 1) * (p^{a-1} * φ(p^a)) over all primes p and exponents a. But φ(p^a) = p^{a-1}(p - 1), so substituting that in, the sum becomes (p - 1) * p^{a-1} * (p - 1) = (p - 1)^2 * p^{a-1}. Therefore, the sum is equal to (p - 1)^2 * p^{a-1} over all primes p and exponents a. So, the sum is equal to the product over all primes p and exponents a of (p - 1)^2 * p^{a-1}.\n\nBut the problem states that this sum is equal to (3n² + 5)/8.

But since the problem states that n is a positive integer, the only possible value for a is 0. Therefore, the only possible value for n is 1. Let me check if n=1 works.\n\nFor n=1, the sum is φ(1) = 1. The right-hand side is (3*1² + 5)/8 = 8/8 = 1. So, 1 = 1, which is true. Therefore, n=1 is a solution.\n\nNow, let's check if there are any other solutions. If n is greater than 1, then the sum would be the product over all primes p and exponents a of (p - 1)^2 * p^{a-1}. But since the sum is equal to (3n² + 5)/8, which is a constant, the product over primes and exponents must also be a constant. However, the product over primes and exponents is a function of n, and the right-hand side is a constant. Therefore, the only way this can hold is if the exponents a are all zero.

Let's start by splitting the original series into three parts:\n\n1. The sum of \\( n^2 x^n \\)\n2. The sum of \\( 3n x^n \\)\n3. The sum of \\( -5 x^n \\)\n\nEach of these can be handled using known series expansions. Let's compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, consider the sum of \\( n^2 x^n \\). The formula for the sum of \\( n^2 x^n \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} n^2 x^n = \\frac{x(1 + x)}{(1 - x)^3}\n\\]\n\nThis formula can be derived using techniques involving generating functions or differentiation of known series. Let's verify this formula by induction or by using known results.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute it directly. Let's compute the first few terms to see the pattern:\n\nFor \\( n = 0 \\): \\( 0^2 x^0 = 0 \\)\nFor \\( n = 1 \\): \\( 1^2 x^1 = x \\)\nFor \\( n = 2 \\): \\( 2^2 x^2 = 4x^2 \\)\nFor \\( n = 3 \\): \\( 3^2 x^3 = 9x^3 \\)\nFor \\( n = 4 \\): \\( 4^2 x^4 = 16x^4 \\)\n...\n\nThe sum is \\( x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 9x^4 + 16x^5 + \\cdots \\). Let's denote this sum as \\( S_1 \\).\n\nNext, consider the sum of \\( 3n x^n \\). This is similar to the previous sum, but with a factor of 3. Therefore, the sum is:\n\n\\[\n3 \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} n x^n = 3 \\cdot \\frac{x(1 + x)}{(1 - x)^3} = \\frac{3x(1 + x)}{(1 - x)^3}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, compute the first few terms:\n\nFor \\( n = 0 \\): \\( 0 \\cdot 3x^0 = 0 \\)\nFor \\( n = 1 \\): \\( 1 \\cdot 3x^1 = 3x \\)\nFor \\( n = 2 \\): \\( 2 \\cdot 3x^2 = 6x^2 \\)\nFor \\( n = 3 \\): \\( 3 \\cdot 3x^3 = 9x^3 \\)\nFor \\( n = 4 \\): \\( 4 \\cdot 3x^4 = 12x^4 \\)\n...\n\nThe sum is \\( 3x + 6x^2 + 9x^3 + 12x^4 + \\cdots \\).

Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem. The expression is a ratio of two terms: the numerator is the sum of xy and 2yz, and the denominator is the sum of squares of x, y, and z. Since x, y, z are not all zero, we need to consider different cases where some variables are zero. But since the problem says \"not all zero,\" maybe we can assume that at least one of them is non-zero. Let me think.\n\nFirst, maybe I can use some inequalities to bound the expression. Since the numerator is xy + 2yz and the denominator is x² + y² + z², maybe I can apply Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or AM-GM inequality. Let me try AM-GM here. The numerator is xy + 2yz. Let's see if I can split this into two terms that might be easier to handle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express the numerator as a sum of two terms: xy and 2yz. Let's see if I can factor or rearrange this. Let's try to write xy + 2yz as a sum of two terms. Hmm, maybe xy + 2yz can be written as x(y + 2z). Let me check: if x = 0, then the numerator is 0 + 0 = 0, which is allowed. If x ≠ 0, then x(y + 2z) is a valid expression. So, the numerator is x(y + 2z). Therefore, the entire expression becomes (x(y + 2z)) / (x² + y² + z²). Let me denote this as f(x, y, z) = (xy + 2yz) / (x² + y² + z²) = x(y + 2z) / (x² + y² + z²). So, f(x, y, z) = x(y + 2z) / (x² + y² + z²). So, the problem reduces to maximizing x(y + 2z) over all real numbers x, y, z where x, y, z are not all zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Let's apply it to the numerator and denominator. Let's consider the vectors (x, y, z) and (y, 2z, 0). Then, the dot product of these two vectors is xy + 2yz + 0*0 = xy + 2yz. The magnitude of the first vector is sqrt(x² + y² + z²), and the magnitude of the second vector is sqrt(y² + (2z)² + 0²) = sqrt(y² + 4z²). So, by Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, (xy + 2yz) ≤ sqrt(x² + y² + z²) * sqrt(y² + 4z²). Therefore, f(x, y, z) ≤ sqrt(x² + y² + z²) * sqrt(y² + 4z²). So, the maximum value of f(x, y, z) is less than or equal to sqrt(x² + y² + z²) * sqrt(y² + 4z²).

This can be achieved when x = 2, y = 0, z = 0. Let me verify this.\n\nFirst, let's compute the numerator and denominator when x = 2, y = 0, z = 0:\n\nNumerator: xy + 2yz = (2)(0) + 2(0)(0) = 0 + 0 = 0\n\nDenominator: x² + y² + z² = (2)² + 0² + 0² = 4 + 0 + 0 = 4\n\nSo, the expression becomes 0/4 = 0. But wait, the problem states that x, y, z are real numbers, not all zero. So, if x = 2, y = 0, z = 0, then the denominator is 4, which is positive. The numerator is 0, so the expression is 0/4 = 0.

Since he connects every pair of points that are 1 unit apart, forming a 10x10 grid of unit squares, we need to compute the sum of the lengths of all such segments.\n\nFirst, let's consider the structure of the grid. An 11x11 grid has 11 rows and 11 columns of lattice points. Each row and each column contains 11 points. The number of unit segments connecting two points in the same row or column is equal to the number of points minus one, since each point can be connected to the next one.

But since the 5th place's score is different from the 4th place's score, that means the 5th place's score is either higher or lower. Wait, but the problem says \"the 5th place's score is different from the 4th place's score\". So, the 5th place's score is not equal to the 4th place's score.

So, the 5th place's score is not equal to the 4th place's score\n\n<answer>\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. First, we need to determine the number of teams that participated in the tournament. Since it's a round-robin tournament, the number of teams is equal to the number of games played. Each game involves two teams, so the total number of games is n(n-1)/2, where n is the number of teams. Therefore, the number of teams is n(n-1)/2.\n\nNow, let's consider the points scored by the teams. The problem states that the 1st to 4th places scored 11, 9, 7, and 5 points respectively. The 5th place's score is different from the 4th place's score. The winner gets 2 points, the loser gets 0, and in a draw, both get 1 point. So, the total points scored by all teams is the sum of the points of the 1st to 4th places plus the points of the 5th place. But since the 5th place's score is different from the 4th place's score, that means the 5th place's score is not equal to the 4th place's score", "e71c071_correct": false}

Let me start by recalling what an equilateral hyperbola is. An equilateral hyperbola is a hyperbola where the asymptotes are perpendicular to each other. The standard form of an equilateral hyperbola is x²/a² - y²/b² = 1, where a and b are the semi-major and semi-minor axes, respectively. The foci are located at (±c, 0), where c² = a² + b². Since the foci are on the Ox axis, the hyperbola is horizontal, so the standard form is x²/a² - y²/b² = 1. The foci are at (±c, 0), so c = sqrt(a² + b²). The asymptotes of this hyperbola are y = ±(b/a)x. Since they are perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1. So, (b/a)(-b/a) = -1, which simplifies to b²/a² = 1, so b = ±a. But since the hyperbola is horizontal, the asymptotes are y = ±(b/a)x, which would be y = ±x. But in an equilateral hyperbola, the asymptotes are perpendicular, so they are y = ±x. Therefore, the slopes of the asymptotes are ±1, so b/a = 1, which means b = a. Therefore, the hyperbola is x²/a² - y²/a² = 1, which simplifies to x² - y² = a². So, the equation is x² - y² = a². Now, we need to find the value of a. Since the hyperbola passes through the point M(4, -2), we can substitute x = 4 and y = -2 into the equation to find a. Let's do that.\n\nx² - y² = a²\n4² - (-2)² = a²\n16 - 4 = a²\n12 = a²\nTherefore, a = sqrt(12) = 2*sqrt(3). So, the equation of the hyperbola is x² - y² = (2*sqrt(3))² = 12. Let me check if this is correct. The foci would be at (±sqrt(12 + 12), 0) = (±sqrt(24), 0) = (±2*sqrt(6), 0). The asymptotes would be y = ±x, which are perpendicular. So, the hyperbola is indeed equilateral. The point M(4, -2) lies on the hyperbola, so that's correct. Therefore, the equation is x² - y² = 12. Let me verify that the foci are on the Ox axis. The foci are at (±sqrt(12 + 12), 0) = (±sqrt(24), 0) = (±2*sqrt(6), 0). Since the foci are on the Ox axis, the hyperbola is horizontal. The point M(4, -2) is on the hyperbola, so that's correct.

Let me set the equations equal to each other to find where they cross. So, x² = x. Let me solve that equation.\n\nx² - x = 0 => x(x - 1) = 0. So, x = 0 or x = 1. That means the curves intersect at x = 0 and x = 1. So, the interval of integration is from 0 to 1.\n\nNow, I need to determine which function is above the other in this interval. Let's check at x = 0. When x = 0, y = 0² = 0 for the parabola, and y² = 0 for the hyperbola. So, y = 0 for both. Then at x = 1, y = 1² = 1 for the parabola, and y² = 1 for the hyperbola.

The question is asking for the probability that all 3 red chips are drawn before both green chips are drawn. The answer choices are given, so I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the process. We start with 3 red and 2 green chips. The goal is to draw all 3 reds before drawing both green chips. So, the sequence must be RRR before GG. The question is asking for the probability of this happening.\n\nHmm, maybe I can model this as a Markov chain or use conditional probabilities. Let me think. The key here is that the order in which the chips are drawn matters. So, the probability of drawing all reds before both greens depends on the order in which the chips are drawn. Since the chips are drawn without replacement, the probability changes with each draw.\n\nLet me consider the possible sequences. The first red chip can be drawn on the first, second, or third draw. Let's break it down.\n\nCase 1: First red chip is drawn on the first draw. Then, the remaining chips are 2 reds and 2 greens. The probability of drawing all 3 reds before both greens is the same as the probability of drawing all 3 reds in a sequence of 3 reds and 2 greens. But since the first red is already drawn, we need to consider the remaining 2 reds and 2 greens. The probability of drawing all 3 reds in a sequence of 3 reds and 2 greens is 1, because once the first red is drawn, the remaining 2 reds and 2 greens are all reds. So, the probability here is 1.\n\nCase 2: First red chip is drawn on the second draw. Then, the remaining chips are 1 red and 2 greens. The probability of drawing all 3 reds before both greens is the probability of drawing all 3 reds in a sequence of 1 red and 2 greens.

The question is asking for the probability that all 3 red chips are drawn before both green chips are drawn. The answer choices are given, so I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the process. We start with 3 red and 2 green chips. The goal is to draw all 3 reds before drawing both green chips. So, the sequence must be RRR before GG. The question is asking for the probability of this happening.\n\nHmm, maybe I can model this as a Markov chain or use conditional probabilities. Let me think. The key here is that the order in which the chips are drawn matters. So, the probability of drawing all reds before both greens depends on the order in which the chips are drawn. Since the chips are drawn without replacement, the probability changes with each draw.\n\nLet me consider the possible sequences. The first red chip can be drawn on the first, second, or third draw. Let's break it down.\n\nCase 1: First red chip is drawn on the first draw. Then, the remaining chips are 2 reds and 2 greens. The probability of drawing all 3 reds before both greens is the same as the probability of drawing all 3 reds in a sequence of 3 reds and 2 greens. But since the first red is already drawn, we need to consider the remaining 2 reds and 2 greens. The probability of drawing all 3 reds in a sequence of 3 reds and 2 greens is 1, because once the first red is drawn, the remaining 2 reds and 2 greens are all reds. So, the probability here is 1.\n\nCase 2: First red chip is drawn on the second draw. Then, the remaining chips are 1 red and 2 greens. The probability of drawing all 3 reds before both greens is the probability of drawing all 3 reds in a sequence of 1 red and 2 greens. The probability of drawing all 3 reds in a sequence of 1 red and 2 greens is 1, because once the first red is drawn, the remaining 2 reds and 2 greens are all reds. So, the probability here is 1.\n\nCase 3: First red chip is drawn on the third draw. Then, the remaining chips are 2 reds and 1 green. The probability of drawing all 3 reds before both greens is the probability of drawing all 3 reds in a sequence of 2 reds and 1 green. The probability of drawing all 3 reds in a sequence of 2 reds and 1 green is 1, because once the first red is drawn, the remaining 2 reds and 1 green are all reds. So, the probability here is 1.\n\nWait, but let me check if this reasoning is correct. Let's consider the total number of possible sequences.

To check if a number is divisible by 3, I remember that the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. Let me apply this to 287. The digits are 2, 8, and 7. Adding them up: 2 + 8 + 7 equals 17. Since 17 is not divisible by 3 (3*6=18, 3*7=21), 287 is not divisible by 3. So option A is out.\n\nNext, option B is 4. For divisibility by 4, the last two digits of the number must form a number that's divisible by 4. Let's check 287. The last two digits are 87. 87 divided by 4 is 21.75, which isn't an integer. So 87 isn't divisible by 4, so 287 isn't divisible by 4. Option B is eliminated.\n\nOption C is 5. A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is either 0 or 5. The last digit of 287 is 7. Since 7 is neither 0 nor 5, 287 is not divisible by 5. So option C is incorrect.\n\nOption D is 7. To check divisibility by 7, I can perform the division. 287 divided by 7. Let's see: 7 times 40 is 280, and 7 times 7 is 49. Subtracting 280 from 287 gives 7. So 287 divided by 7 is 40 with a remainder of 7. Since there's a remainder, 287 is not divisible by 7.

Let me think about how to approach this. First, let's recall that a 2x2 matrix over a field F can be written as:\n\n[a b]\n[c d]\n\nwhere a, b, c, d are elements of F. The trace of this matrix is a + d, and the determinant is ad - bc. The problem states that the trace is 1 and the determinant is 0. So, we have two equations:\n\n1. a + d = 1\n2. ad - bc = 0\n\nWe need to find the number of solutions (a, b, c, d) that satisfy both equations. Since F is a field with p elements, each variable can take any value in F. Therefore, the number of solutions is p^4, since each of the four variables can be chosen independently. However, we need to verify if all these solutions satisfy both equations.\n\nLet's start by expressing d in terms of a from the first equation: d = 1 - a. Then substitute this into the second equation:\n\na*(1 - a) - bc = 0\n\nSimplify this equation:\n\na - a² - bc = 0 => bc = a - a²\n\nSo, bc = a(1 - a). Now, we need to find all pairs (b, c) such that bc = a(1 - a). Since F is a field with p elements, the number of solutions for (b, c) is equal to the number of elements in F multiplied by the number of elements in F that satisfy bc = a(1 - a). However, since F is a field, the number of solutions for (b, c) is equal to the number of elements in F, which is p. Therefore, for each a in F, there are p possible (b, c) pairs. But we need to check if these pairs satisfy the original equations.\n\nLet's consider the possible values of a. Since a is in F, which has p elements, there are p possible values for a. For each a, there are p possible (b, c) pairs such that bc = a(1 - a). Therefore, the total number of solutions is p * p = p². However, we need to verify if all these solutions satisfy the original equations.\n\nLet's check if all these solutions satisfy the original equations. Let's take an example. Suppose a = 0. Then d = 1 - 0 = 1. Then bc = 0*(1 - 0) = 0. So, bc = 0. Therefore, any pair (b, c) such that bc = 0 is a solution. Since F has p elements, there are p possible (b, c) pairs where bc = 0. Therefore, for a = 0, there are p solutions. Similarly, for a = 1, d = 0, so bc = 1*(1 - 1) = 0. Therefore, any pair (b, c) such that bc = 0 is a solution. Again, there are p possible (b, c) pairs where bc = 0. Therefore, for a = 1, there are p solutions. Similarly, for a = 2, d = 1 - 2 = -1. Then bc = 2*(-1) = -2.

Again, there are p possible (b, c) pairs where bc = 0. Therefore, for a = 1, there are p solutions. Similarly, for a = 2, d = 1 - 2 = -1. Then bc = 2*(-1) = -2.

The trace of this matrix is a + d, and the determinant is ad - bc. The problem states that the trace is 1 and the determinant is 0.

Let me start by visualizing the square ABCD. Since it's a square, all sides are equal, and all angles are 90 degrees. The square has four vertices: A, B, C, D.

Hmm, let's start by understanding what each term in the sum represents. Each term is [x / n!], which is the greatest integer less than or equal to x divided by n factorial. So, for example, [x / 1!] is the floor of x divided by 1, which is just x. Similarly, [x / 2!] is the floor of x divided by 2, and so on up to [x / 10!], which is the floor of x divided by 10 factorial. The sum of these terms equals 1001. Since x is an integer, each term is an integer as well, so the sum of integers is an integer. Therefore, 1001 must be an integer, which it is, so that's good. But how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, let's consider the range of x. Since each term is [x / n!], the value of each term depends on how x is distributed among the factorials. For example, if x is between n! and 2n!, then [x / n!] would be n, because x is just above n! and below 2n!. So, the maximum value of each term is n, and the minimum is 1. Therefore, the sum of 10 terms (from 1! to 10!) would be between 10*1 = 10 and 10*10 = 100. So, the total sum is between 10 and 100. Therefore, x must be between 10 and 100. But wait, the problem says \"integer solution\", so x is an integer. Therefore, x must be between 10 and 100, inclusive. So, x is in the range 10 ≤ x ≤ 100.\n\nNow, let's think about how x can be distributed among the factorials. For example, if x is between 10! and 20!, then each term [x / n!] would be 10, because x is just above 10! and below 20!. So, in that case, all 10 terms would be 10, and the sum would be 10*10 = 100. But we need the sum to be 1001. So, x must be in a range where the sum of 10 terms is 1001. Let's see, if x is between 10! and 20!, then each term is 10, so the sum is 10*10 = 100. But 100 is less than 1001, so x must be in a range where the sum is higher. Let's see, if x is between 20! and 30!, then each term is 20, so the sum would be 20*10 = 200. Still less than 1001. So, x must be in a range where the sum is higher. Let's see, if x is between 30! and 40!, then each term is 30, so the sum would be 30*10 = 300. Still less.

Find the ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the pyramid, if the lateral edge of the pyramid makes an angle $\\alpha$ with the base plane.\n\n<think>\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\n<think>\nAlright, so I need to find the ratio of the volume of a cube inscribed in a regular quadrilateral pyramid to the volume of the pyramid itself. The pyramid has a regular quadrilateral base, and the cube is inscribed such that its upper base lies on the lateral edges, and its lower base is in the base plane. The lateral edge makes an angle α with the base plane. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.\n\nFirst, a regular quadrilateral pyramid. That means the base is a square, and the apex is directly above the center of the base. The lateral edges are the edges connecting the apex to each vertex of the base. The problem states that the cube is inscribed in this pyramid. So, the cube's upper base is on the lateral edges, which means the cube's upper base is parallel to the base of the pyramid and lies on the lateral edges. The lower base of the cube is in the base plane of the pyramid. The lateral edge of the pyramid makes an angle α with the base plane. So, the lateral edge is inclined at angle α to the base plane.\n\nSince the pyramid is regular, the lateral edges are all equal in length. Let me denote the side length of the base square as 'a', and the height of the pyramid as 'h'. The lateral edge length would then be √(a² + h²), right? Because the lateral edge connects the apex to a vertex of the base, forming a right triangle with the height of the pyramid and half the base side length.\n\nNow, the cube is inscribed in the pyramid. The cube's upper base is on the lateral edges, so the cube's upper base is parallel to the base of the pyramid and lies on the lateral edges.

A cube is inscribed in a regular quadrilateral pyramid; the vertices of its upper base lie on the lateral edges, and the vertices of its lower base are in the plane of the pyramid's base. Find the ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the pyramid, if the lateral edge of the pyramid makes an angle $\\alpha$ with the base plane.\n\n<think>\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\n<think>\nAlright, so I need to find the ratio of the volume of a cube inscribed in a regular quadrilateral pyramid to the volume of the pyramid itself. The pyramid has a regular quadrilateral base, and the cube is inscribed such that its upper base lies on the lateral edges, and its lower base is in the base plane. The lateral edge makes an angle α with the base plane. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.\n\nFirst, a regular quadrilateral pyramid. That means the base is a square, and the apex is directly above the center of the base. The lateral edges are the edges connecting the apex to each vertex of the base. The problem states that the cube is inscribed in this pyramid. So, the cube's upper base is on the lateral edges, which means the cube's upper base is parallel to the base of the pyramid and lies on the lateral edges. The lower base of the cube is in the base plane of the pyramid. The lateral edge of the pyramid makes an angle α with the base plane. So, the lateral edge is inclined at angle α to the base plane.\n\nSince the pyramid is regular, the lateral edges are all equal in length. Let me denote the side length of the base square as 'a', and the height of the pyramid as 'h'. The lateral edge length would then be √(a² + h²), right? Because the lateral edge connects the apex to a vertex of the base, forming a right triangle with the height of the pyramid and half the base side length.\n\nNow, the cube is inscribed in the pyramid. The cube's upper base is on the lateral edges, so the cube's upper base is parallel to the base of the pyramid and lies on the lateral edges. The lower base of the cube is in the base plane of the pyramid. So, the cube's lower base is a square that lies on the base plane, and the upper base is a square that is parallel to the base and lies on the lateral edges. The cube's edges are perpendicular to the base plane, so the cube's edges are perpendicular to the lateral edges.\n\nGiven that the lateral edge makes an angle α with the base plane, the lateral edge is inclined at angle α. So, the lateral edge is at an angle α to the base plane. Therefore, the lateral edge is inclined at angle α to the base plane. Since the lateral edge is the edge from the apex to a vertex of the base, and the base is a square, the lateral edge is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with the height of the pyramid and half the base side length. So, the lateral edge length is √(a² + h²). The angle α is the angle between the lateral edge and the base plane. Therefore, the lateral edge is inclined at angle α to the base plane.\n\nNow, the cube is inscribed in the pyramid. The cube's upper base is on the lateral edges, so the cube's upper base is parallel to the base of the pyramid and lies on the lateral edges. The lower base of the cube is in the base plane of the pyramid.

It's a regular quadrilateral pyramid with a square base. Let's denote the side length of the base as 'a' and the height of the pyramid as 'h'. The lateral edge length is √(a² + h²), as you correctly noted. The lateral edge makes an angle α with the base plane. Therefore, the lateral edge is inclined at angle α to the base plane.\n\nThe cube is inscribed in the pyramid such that its upper base lies on the lateral edges, and its lower base is in the base plane. The cube's upper base is parallel to the base of the pyramid and lies on the lateral edges. The lower base of the cube is in the base plane of the pyramid. The lateral edge of the pyramid makes an angle α with the base plane.\n\nSince the pyramid is regular, the lateral edges are all equal in length. Let's denote the lateral edge length as 'l'. Then, l = √(a² + h²). The angle α is the angle between the lateral edge and the base", "e71c071_correct": false}

To solve this problem, we need to find coefficients A, B, and C such that the expression A√3 + B√9 + C is equivalent to 12√3 + 52√9 + 49. Let's start by expressing the given expression in terms of √3 and √9. Since √9 is 3, we can rewrite the expression as A√3 + 3B + C.

Hmm, let's start by recalling some trigonometric identities and properties of triangles.\n\nFirst, in any triangle, the sum of the interior angles is 180 degrees. So, A + B + C = 180°. Since A is one of the angles, we can express B and C in terms of A. Let's see. If A is one angle, then B and C are the other two angles. So, B = 180° - A - C. But since angles in a triangle are between 0 and 180 degrees, B must be between 0 and 180°. However, since B is an interior angle, it's less than 180°, so 180° - A - C < 180°. But since A is one of the angles, this inequality is always true. So, B is a valid angle.\n\nSimilarly, C is also an interior angle, so C must be between 0 and 180°. Therefore, B and C are both between 0 and 180°.\n\nNow, the expression we need to minimize is cos A(sin B + sin C). Let me write that down:\n\ncos A(sin B + sin C)\n\nTo find the minimum value, I might want to consider the possible values of B and C. Since B and C are angles in a triangle, they can vary between 0 and 180°. However, since A is one of the angles, the other two angles B and C can be adjusted to satisfy the triangle inequality. But since we are looking for the minimum value of the expression, perhaps we can consider the case where B and C are as small as possible, but still satisfy the triangle inequality.\n\nWait, but in a triangle, the sum of any two angles must be greater than the third. So, for example, if B and C are both small, then A must be large. But A is one of the angles, so if B and C are both small, then A must be large. But A is an interior angle, so its value depends on the other two angles. However, since we are looking for the minimum value of the expression, perhaps we can consider the case where B and C are as small as possible, but still satisfy the triangle inequality.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use calculus to find the minimum value. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet me set x = sin B and y = sin C. Then the expression becomes cos A(x + y).

Therefore, the expression is cos A(x + y), where x + y is between 0 and 2.\n\nTo minimize cos A(x + y), we need to maximize x + y. Since x + y is between 0 and 2, the maximum value of x + y is 2. Therefore, the minimum value of cos A(x + y) is cos A * 2. But we need to find the minimum value of cos A(x + y), which is cos A * 2.

Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall that a week has 7 days, so every 7 days, the days of the week repeat. Therefore, the number of Mondays in a given period depends on how many weeks are in that period and how many extra days are left over. The key here is to figure out how many weeks and extra days are in the first 45 days of the year.\n\nLet me start by calculating how many weeks are in 45 days. Since there are 7 days in a week, I can divide 45 by 7 to find the number of complete weeks and the remainder.\n\n45 ÷ 7 = 6 with a remainder of 3.

So, the first 45 days of the year would have 6 Mondays (since each week has one Monday) and 3 additional Mondays from the extra days.\n\nTherefore, the total number of Mondays would be 6 + 3 = 9.

Hmm, let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a week has seven days, so every seven days, the days of the week repeat. That means that the number of Mondays in a given period depends on how many weeks are in that period and how many extra days are left over. So, I need to figure out how many weeks are in 45 days and how many extra days there are.\n\nLet me calculate that. 45 divided by 7. 7 times 6 is 42, so 45 minus 42 is 3. So, 45 days is 6 weeks and 3 extra days. That makes sense because 6 weeks would be 42 days, and 3 extra days would bring the total to 45 days.\n\nNow, since each week has one Monday, the number of Mondays in the first 45 days would be equal to the number of weeks, which is 6. But wait, hold on. Wait, no. Let me check again.\n\nIf there are 6 weeks, that would be 6 Mondays. But then, the extra 3 days would be the first three days of the next week. So, the first 45 days would have 6 Mondays from the first 42 days, plus the first three days of the next week. So, actually, the total number of Mondays would be 6 + 3 = 9. So, the greatest number of Mondays in the first 45 days is 9. So, the answer should be (E) 9.\n\nBut let me double-check. If I take 45 days and divide by 7, I get 6 weeks and 3 days.

That means that the number of Mondays in a given period depends on how many weeks are in that period and how many extra days are left over. So, I need to figure out how many weeks are in 45 days and how many extra days there are.\n\nLet me calculate that. 45 divided by 7. 7 times 6 is 42, so 45 minus 42 is 3. So, 45 days is 6 weeks and 3 extra days. That makes sense because 6 weeks would be 42 days, and 3 extra days would bring the total to 45 days.\n\nNow, since each week has one Monday, the number of Mondays in the first 45 days would be equal to the number of weeks, which is 6. But wait, hold on. Wait, no. Let me check again.\n\nIf there are 6 weeks, that would be 6 Mondays. But then, the extra 3 days would be the first three days of the next week. So, the first 45 days would have 6 Mondays from the first 42 days, plus the first three days of the next week. So, actually, the total number of Mondays would be 6 + 3 = 9. So, the greatest number of Mondays in the first 45 days is 9. So, the answer should be (E) 9.\n\nBut let me double-check. If I take 45 days and divide by 7, I get 6 weeks and 3 days. So, 6 weeks would be 6 Mondays, and the next day would be the first day of the next week, which is a Monday. So\n\n<answer>\n(E) 9\n</answer>You first briefly think about the reasoning process as an internal monologue and then provide the user with the answer.\n<think>\nOkay, so the problem is asking for the greatest number of Mondays that can occur in the first 45 days of a year. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall that a week has seven days. So, every seven days, the days of the week repeat. Therefore, the number of Mondays in a given period depends on how many complete weeks are in that period and how many extra days are left over. The key here is to figure out how many weeks and extra days are in the first 45 days of the year.\n\nLet me start by calculating how many weeks are in 45 days. Since there are 7 days in a week, I can divide 45 by 7. Let me do that division.\n\n45 divided by 7. 7 times 6 is 42, so 45 minus 42 is 3. So, 45 days is 6 weeks and 3 extra days. That makes sense because 6 weeks would be 42 days,", "e71c071_correct": false}

The formula for the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers is n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6. So, plugging in n = 2017, that would be 2017*2018*4035/6.

Let's divide 16363033180 by 6. 16363033180 ÷ 6 = 2727172196. So the sum of squares is 2727172196.\n\nNow, the second part is the sum of the products of consecutive terms: 1*3 + 2*4 + ... + 2016*2018. Let me write that as Σ_{k=1}^{2016} k(k + 2). Let me compute this sum. The general term is k(k + 2) = k² + 2k. So, the sum is Σ_{k=1}^{2016} (k² + 2k) = Σ_{k=1}^{2016} k² + 2 Σ_{k=1}^{2016} k.

The allowed operations are subtracting 1 from each entry in a row or adding 1 to each entry in a column. The goal is to find how many such arrays exist.\n\nFirst, let's consider the constraints. Each row must have a sum divisible by 2013, and each column must also have a sum divisible by 2013. Since the array is $2013 \\times 2013$, there are 2013 rows and 2013 columns. Each row and each column must be a multiple of 2013. However, since the entries are integers between 1 and 2013, the sum of each row and column can be at most $2013 \\times 2013 = 2013^2$. Therefore, the sum of each row and column must be a multiple of 2013, which is already satisfied by the constraints. However, the problem is about whether it's possible to achieve such a configuration with the given operations.\n\nLet's analyze the operations. The first operation is subtracting 1 from each entry in a row, which decreases the sum of that row by 2013. The second operation is adding 1 to each entry in a column, which increases the sum of that column by 2013. Therefore, each operation affects the sum of its respective row or column by 2013. Since the sum of each row and column must be divisible by 2013, the operations can only change the sum by multiples of 2013. However, the operations can only be applied once per row or column, so the total change in the sum of each row or column is 2013. Therefore, the total sum of all rows must be a multiple of 2013, and the total sum of all columns must also be a multiple of 2013. Since there are 2013 rows and 2013 columns, the total sum of all entries in the array is the sum of all rows plus the sum of all columns. Therefore, the total sum must be a multiple of 2013. Let's denote the total sum as S. Then, S = sum of all rows + sum of all columns = 2013 * (sum of all rows) = 2013 * (sum of all columns). Therefore, S must be a multiple of 2013. So, the total sum S is a multiple of 2013. Therefore, the problem reduces to determining whether it's possible to arrange the numbers 1 to 2013 in the array such that the sum of each row and each column is a multiple of 2013.\n\nHowever, the problem is about whether it's possible to achieve such a configuration with the given operations.

The total distance is 168 km. To find out how many kilometers per day she needs to average for the remaining days, I should first calculate the distance she has already covered and then subtract that from the total to find the remaining distance. Then, divide that remaining distance by the number of days left, which is 3, since she has already used 3 days. Let me do that step by step.\n\nFirst, let's compute the distance Andrea has covered. She has completed 3/7 of the trip. The total trip is 168 km. So, the distance covered is (3/7)*168. Let me calculate that. 168 divided by 7 is 24, so 3 times 24 is 72. So, Andrea has covered 72 km so far. That makes sense because 3/7 of 168 is 72. So, the remaining distance is 168 - 72 = 96 km. That's the distance she still needs to cover.\n\nNow, the number of days left is 6 - 3 = 3 days. So, she has 3 days left to cover the remaining 96 km. To find the average distance per day, I divide the remaining distance by the number of days left. So, 96 divided by 3. Let me do that. 96 divided by 3 is 32. So, Andrea needs to average 32 km per day for the remaining days. Looking at the options, that's option D. So, the answer should be D) 32.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations. Let me verify the distance covered. 3/7 of 168 is indeed 72. Then, 168 - 72 = 96. Then, 96 divided by 3 is 32. Yes, that's correct. So, the answer is D) 32. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the division. 96 divided by 3 is 32, so that's right. So, the answer is D) 32. Alright, that seems right. The answer is D) 32.

Hmm, let me start by understanding the domain of this function. Since all the square roots are involved, each term inside the square roots must be non-negative. So, for the first term, x + 27 ≥ 0, which implies x ≥ -27. The second term, 13 - x ≥ 0, so x ≤ 13. The third term, √x, requires x ≥ 0. So combining these, the domain of x is from -27 to 13, inclusive. That's a good start.\n\nNow, since this is a function with three square root terms, it's likely that the maximum occurs at a critical point where the derivative is zero or at the endpoints of the domain. But since the function is continuous and differentiable on the domain, I can check for critical points by setting the derivative equal to zero and solving for x. Let me compute the derivative of f(x).\n\nFirst, let's compute the derivative of each term. The derivative of √(x + 27) is (1/(2√(x + 27))) * 1 = 1/(2√(x + 27)). Similarly, the derivative of √(13 - x) is (-1/(2√(13 - x))) * 1 = -1/(2√(13 - x)). The derivative of √x is (1/(2√x)) * 1 = 1/(2√x). So putting it all together, the derivative f'(x) is:\n\nf'(x) = 1/(2√(x + 27)) - 1/(2√(13 - x)) + 1/(2√x)\n\nTo find the critical points, set f'(x) = 0:\n\n1/(2√(x + 27)) - 1/(2√(13 - x)) + 1/(2√x) = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by 2√x√(x + 27)√(13 - x) to eliminate denominators:\n\n√x√(x + 27)√(13 - x) = 2√(x + 27)√(13 - x) + 2√x\n\nLet me simplify the left side. Let me denote a = √x, b = √(x + 27), c = √(13 - x). Then, the equation becomes:\n\na * b * c = 2bc + 2a\n\nDivide both sides by 2bc:\n\na = 2 + 2/a\n\nMultiply both sides by a:\n\na² = 2a + 2a²\n\nSubtract 2a² from both sides:\n\na² - 2a² = 2a\n\n- a² = 2a\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\na² + 2a = 0\n\nFactor out a:\n\na(a + 2) = 0\n\nSo, a = 0 or a = -2. Since a = √x, which is non-negative, a cannot be negative. Therefore, a = 0. So √x = 0 => x = 0.\n\nBut wait, x = 0 is not in the domain because it's outside the interval [-27, 1\n\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant that provides well‑reasoned but short responses.\nYou first briefly think about the reasoning process as an internal monologue and then provide the user with the answer.\nRespond in the following format:\n\nProblem: 1.

That's a good start.\n\nNow, since this is a function with three square root terms, it's likely that the maximum occurs at a critical point where the derivative is zero or at the endpoints of the domain. But since the function is continuous and differentiable on the domain, I can check for critical points by setting the derivative equal to zero and solving for x. Let me compute the derivative of f(x).\n\nFirst, let's compute the derivative of each term. The derivative of √(x + 27) is (1/(2√(x + 27))) * 1 = 1/(2√(x + 27)). Similarly, the derivative of √(13 - x) is (-1/(2√(13 - x))) * 1 = -1/(2√(13 - x)). The derivative of √x is (1/(2√x)) * 1 = 1/(2√x). So putting it all together, the derivative f'(x) is:\n\nf'(x) = 1/(2√(x + 27)) - 1/(2√(13 - x)) + 1/(2√x)\n\nTo find the critical points, set f'(x) = 0:\n\n1/(2√(x + 27)) - 1/(2√(13 - x)) + 1/(2√x) = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by 2√x√(x + 27)√(13 - x) to eliminate denominators:\n\n√x√(x + 27)√(13 - x) = 2√(x + 27)√(13 - x) + 2√x\n\nLet me simplify the left side. Let me denote a = √x, b = √(x + 27), c = √(13 - x). Then, the equation becomes:\n\na * b * c = 2bc + 2a\n\nDivide both sides by 2bc:\n\na = 2 + 2/a\n\nMultiply both sides by a:\n\na² = 2a + 2a²\n\nSubtract 2a² from both sides:\n\na² - 2a² = 2a\n\n- a² = 2a\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\na² + 2a = 0\n\nFactor out a:\n\na(a + 2) = 0\n\nSo, a = 0 or a = -2. Since a = √x, which is non-negative, a cannot be negative. Therefore, a = 0. So √x = 0 => x = 0.\n\nBut wait, x = 0 is not in the domain because it's outside the interval [-27, 1\n\n<answer>\n0\n</answer>You first briefly", "e71c071_correct": false}

Let me start by recalling what a number field is. A number field is a set of numbers that satisfies certain closure properties under addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (except division by zero). So, if I have two numbers in the set, their sum, difference, product, and quotient (when the divisor is not zero) should also be in the set. That seems like a very restrictive condition. Let me think about each proposition one by one.\n\nStarting with proposition (1): \"0 is an element of any number field.\" Hmm, if 0 is not in the set, then the set can't satisfy the closure under addition and subtraction. For example, if 0 is not in the set, then 0 + 0 = 0 is not in the set, which contradicts the closure under addition. Similarly, 0 - 0 = 0 is also not in the set. So, if 0 is not in the set, then the set can't be a number field. Therefore, proposition (1) must be false. So, proposition (1) is false.\n\nMoving on to proposition (2): \"If a number field F has a non-zero element, then 2016 ∈ F.\" Let me think. If a number field has a non-zero element, then that element is in the set. But the problem doesn't specify what the non-zero element is. So, without knowing the specific element, we can't determine whether 2016 is in the set. For example, if the number field is the set of all integers, then 2016 is in the set. But if the number field is the set of all rational numbers, then 2016 is also in the set. But if the number field is the set of all real numbers, then 2016 is in the set. So, depending on the number field, 2016 could or could not be in the set. Therefore, proposition (2) is also false.\n\nNow, proposition (3): \"The set P = {x | x = 3k, k ∈ Z} is a number field.\" Let me check if this set satisfies the closure properties. Let's take two elements from P. Let's say x = 3k and y = 3m, where k and m are integers. Then, their sum is x + y = 3k + 3m = 3(k + m), which is in P. Their difference is x - y = 3k - 3m = 3(k - m), which is also in P. Their product is x * y = 3k * 3m = 9km, which is in P. Their quotient when m ≠ 0 is x / y = (3k)/(3m) = k/m, which is in P. So, P is closed under addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division when m ≠ 0. Therefore, P is a number field. So, proposition (3) is true.\n\nFinally, proposition (4): \"The set of rational numbers is a number field.\" Let me check if the set of rational numbers satisfies the closure properties. Let's take two rational numbers, say a/b and c/d, where a, b, c, d are integers and b, d ≠ 0. Their sum is (a/b) + (c/d) = (ad + bc)/(bd).

Then, I have to compute the sum of all values of P(1/3) over all such polynomials P. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the equation P(z²) = P(z - c)P(z + c) must hold for all complex numbers z. Since P is a nonconstant polynomial, it can have complex roots, but the equation must hold for all z, including those where P(z) = 0. So, the roots of P must be symmetric with respect to z = c. That is, if z is a root, then z + c is also a root. Therefore, the roots of P must lie on the line z = c ± t, where t is a real number. But since P is a polynomial, its roots are isolated, so the roots must be either real or come in conjugate pairs. However, since the equation must hold for all z, the roots must be symmetric with respect to z = c. So, the roots must be either real or come in conjugate pairs, but since the equation is symmetric with respect to z = c, the roots must be symmetric around z = c. Therefore, the roots must be either real or come in conjugate pairs, but since the equation is symmetric, the roots must be symmetric around z = c. So, the roots must be either real or come in conjugate pairs, but since the equation is symmetric, the roots must be symmetric around z = c. Therefore, the roots must be either real or come in conjugate pairs, but since the equation is symmetric, the roots must be symmetric around z = c.

Compute the sum of all values of $P(\\tfrac13)$ over all nonconstant polynomials $P$ satisfying the above constraint for this $c$.\n\n<think>\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\n<think>\nAlright, so I need to find the largest possible real number c such that there exists a nonconstant polynomial P with the equation P(z²) = P(z - c)P(z + c) for all complex numbers z. Then, I have to compute the sum of all values of P(1/3) over all such polynomials P. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the equation P(z²) = P(z - c)P(z + c) must hold for all complex numbers z. Since P is a nonconstant polynomial, it can have complex roots, but the equation must hold for all z, including those where P(z) = 0. So, the roots of P must be symmetric with respect to z = c. That is, if z is a root, then z + c is also a root. Therefore, the roots of P must lie on the line z = c ± t, where t is a real number. But since P is a polynomial, its roots are isolated, so the roots must be either real or come in conjugate pairs. However, since the equation must hold for all z, the roots must be symmetric with respect to z = c. So, the roots must be either real or come in conjugate pairs, but since the equation is symmetric with respect to z = c, the roots must be symmetric around z = c. Therefore, the roots must be either real or come in conjugate pairs, but since the equation is symmetric, the roots must be symmetric around z = c. So, the roots must be either real or come in conjugate pairs, but since the equation is symmetric, the roots must be symmetric around z = c. Therefore, the roots must be either real or come in conjugate pairs, but since the equation is symmetric, the roots must be symmetric around z = c. Therefore, the roots must be either real or come in conjugate pairs, but since the equation is symmetric, the roots must be symmetric around z = c. Therefore, the roots must be either real or come in conjugate pairs, but since the equation is symmetric, the roots must be symmetric around z = c. Therefore, the roots must be either real or come in conjugate pairs, but since the equation is symmetric, the roots must be symmetric around z = c. Therefore, the roots must be either real or come in conjugate pairs, but since the equation is symmetric, the roots must be symmetric around z = c. Therefore, the roots must be either real or come in conjugate pairs, but since the equation is symmetric, the roots must be symmetric around z = c.

Since \\(M\\) is the midpoint of \\(CD\\), and \\(D\\) is a vertex of the trapezoid, the line segment \\(DM\\) is a median of the trapezoid. In a trapezoid, the median (the line segment connecting the midpoints of the non-parallel sides) is equal to the average of the two bases. Therefore, the length of \\(DM\\) is \\(\\frac{5 + 3}{2} = 4\\). Since \\(M\\) is the midpoint of \\(CD\\), \\(DM = 4\\), which matches the length of the median. This is consistent with the given information.\n\nNext, we need to find the height of the trapezoid, which is given as \\(DK\\). Since \\(DK\\) is the height, and \\(K\\) is the midpoint of \\(AB\\), the height \\(DK\\) is the distance between the two parallel sides (bases) of the trapezoid.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem. The function is a combination of tangent and cosine terms, and x is constrained to a specific interval. Since the tangent function has vertical asymptotes at π/2 + kπ, and cosine is periodic with period 2π, maybe I can simplify the expression by using trigonometric identities or perhaps substitution to find the maximum value.\n\nFirst, let me note the interval for x: from -5π/12 to -π/3. Let me convert these angles to degrees to make it easier to visualize. -5π/12 is approximately -112.5°, and -π/3 is approximately -60°. So, x is between -112.5° and -60°. That's a pretty big interval, but maybe I can find the maximum value by considering the critical points within this interval.\n\nSince the function is a combination of tangent and cosine, I might need to find the derivative of y with respect to x and set it equal to zero to find critical points.

Similarly, the derivative of -tan(u) is -sec²(u), so the derivative of -tan(x + π/6) is -sec²(x + π/6).

Let me start by understanding the problem step by step. The cone has a truncated shape, right? The height of the truncated cone is equal to the radius of its larger base. That means the height is the same as the radius of the larger base. So, the larger base is a circle with radius equal to the height. The smaller base is a regular hexagon, and the perimeter of this hexagon is equal to the perimeter of an equilateral triangle inscribed in the larger base. Then, I need to find the angle of inclination of the generatrix (the slant height) to the base plane.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the cone. The larger base is a circle, and the smaller base is a regular hexagon. The height of the truncated cone is equal to the radius of the larger base, so the height is h. The larger base has radius R = h. The smaller base is a regular hexagon inscribed in this circle. The perimeter of the hexagon is equal to the perimeter of the larger base, which is the circumference of the larger circle. So, the perimeter of the hexagon is 6R = 6h. Therefore, the perimeter of the hexagon is equal to the circumference of the larger base.\n\nNow, the perimeter of a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle is equal to 6 times the radius. So, 6R = 6h, which simplifies to R = h. That makes sense because the radius of the larger base is equal to the height of the truncated cone. So, R = h.\n\nNext, the smaller base is a regular hexagon inscribed in the larger circle. The perimeter of the hexagon is 6R = 6h. Since the hexagon is regular, each side is equal to the radius of the circle. So, each side of the hexagon is R = h. Therefore, the side length of the hexagon is h.\n\nNow, the problem states that the perimeter of the regular hexagon is equal to the perimeter of an equilateral triangle inscribed in the larger base. The perimeter of the hexagon is 6h, so the perimeter of the equilateral triangle is also 6h. The perimeter of an equilateral triangle is 3 times the side length. So, 3s = 6h, where s is the side length of the equilateral triangle. Therefore, s = 2h.\n\nSo, the side length of the equilateral triangle inscribed in the larger base is 2h.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when mixing solutions, the total amount of alcohol in the final mixture is the sum of the alcohol from each individual solution. So, if I have two solutions, one with 15% alcohol and another with 35%, and I want to end up with 250 gallons of 21% alcohol, then the total amount of alcohol from both solutions should equal 250 gallons multiplied by 21% (which is 0.21). That seems straightforward.\n\nLet me denote the amount of the 15% solution as x gallons. Then, the amount of the 35% solution would be 250 - x gallons, since the total mixture is 250 gallons. The total amount of alcohol from the 15% solution would be 0.15x, and from the 35% solution, it would be 0.35*(250 - x). The total alcohol in the final mixture should be 0.21*250. So, setting up the equation:\n\n0.15x + 0.35*(250 - x) = 0.21*250\n\nLet me compute that. First, calculate 0.35*(250 - x). That's 0.35*250 minus 0.35*x. 0.35*250 is 87.5, so that's 87.5 - 0.35x. Then, 0.21*250 is 52.5. So the equation becomes:\n\n0.15x + 87.5 - 0.35x = 52.5\n\nNow, let's combine like terms. The x terms are 0.15x and -0.35x. Let's subtract 0.35x from 0.15x:\n\n0.15x - 0.35x = -0.20x\n\nSo the equation simplifies to:\n\n-0.20x + 87.5 = 52.5\n\nSubtract 87.5 from both sides:\n\n-0.20x = 52.5 - 87.5\n\nCalculating 52.5 - 87.5: that's -35. So:\n\n-0.20x = -35\n\nDivide both sides by -0.20:\n\nx = -35 / (-0.20) = 35 / 0.20 = 350 / 2 = 175\n\nSo, x is 175 gallons. That means we need 175 gallons of the 15% alcohol solution. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nIf we mix 175 gallons of 15% with 250 - 175 = 75 gallons of 35%, the total volume is 250 gallons.

The problem says that the equation is satisfied by only one pair of real numbers (x, y), and that the uprising should take place on the N-th day of the month. The patriots often said that the uprising was the only solution, so N must be such that the equation has exactly one real solution. Hmm, so I need to find N where the equation has exactly one real solution for x and y. That means the equation must be a degenerate case where it reduces to a single point, right? Maybe it's a circle, ellipse, hyperbola, etc., but since it's a quadratic equation in two variables, it could be a conic section. Let me recall that a conic section is defined by the equation Ax² + Bxy + Cy² + Dx + Ey + F = 0. The discriminant D = B² - 4AC determines the type of conic. If D < 0, it's an ellipse or hyperbola; if D = 0, it's a parabola; if D > 0, it's a hyperbola. But in this case, the equation is quadratic in both x and y, so it's a conic section. The discriminant D would be related to the coefficients of the quadratic terms. Let me compute D here.\n\nThe equation is 2x² + 4xy + 7y² - 12x - 2y + N = 0. Let's identify the coefficients:\n\nA = 2, B = 4, C = 7, D = -12, E = -2, F = N.\n\nSo the discriminant D is B² - 4AC = 4² - 4*2*7 = 16 - 56 = -40. Since D is negative, the conic is an ellipse or hyperbola. But since the equation is quadratic in both variables, it's a conic section. The problem states that the equation is satisfied by only one pair of real numbers (x, y), so the conic must be degenerate. A degenerate conic can be a point, a line, or a pair of lines. But since it's a quadratic in two variables, it can't be a line. So it must be a point. Therefore, the equation reduces to a single point. For a conic section, this happens when the discriminant D is zero, but here D is negative, so the conic is an ellipse or hyperbola. However, since the equation is quadratic in both variables, it can't be a hyperbola. So it must be an ellipse. Therefore, the equation reduces to a single point, which is an ellipse. So the equation must be an ellipse with a degenerate case, which is a single point. So the equation must be an ellipse that is degenerate into a single point. For an ellipse, this happens when the ellipse is a circle. So the equation must be a circle. Therefore, the equation is a circle.

For a conic section, this happens when the discriminant D is zero, but here D is negative, so the conic is an ellipse or hyperbola. However, since the equation is quadratic in both variables, it can't be a hyperbola. So it must be an ellipse. Therefore, the equation reduces to a single point, which is an ellipse. So the equation must be an ellipse with a degenerate case, which is a single point. So the equation must be an ellipse that is degenerate into a single point. For an ellipse, this happens when the ellipse is a circle. So the equation must be a circle. Therefore, the equation is a circle. So the equation is 2x² + 4xy + 7y² - 12x - 2y + N = 0, which is a circle. To find the value of N, I need to find the center and radius of the circle.

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the setup. In each round, each member of a pair shoots twice. If the total number of successful shots is no less than 3, the pair is considered an \"excellent pair.\" We need to find the probability that Jia and Yi will be an excellent pair in the first round when their individual probabilities of making a shot are given. Then, for part (2), we need to determine the minimum number of rounds required for 16 excellent pairs and find the corresponding probabilities p1 and p2.\n\n**Part (1): Probability that Jia and Yi will be an excellent pair in the first round.**\n\nGiven:\n- p1 = 3/4 (probability Jia makes a shot)\n- p2 = 2/3 (probability Yi makes a shot)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the probability that Jia makes a shot in a single attempt. Since the problem doesn't specify the number of attempts, we assume that each shot is independent. Therefore, the probability that Jia makes a shot in a single attempt is p1 = 3/4.\n\nSimilarly, the probability that Yi makes a shot in a single attempt is p2 = 2/3.\n\nSince the shots are independent, the probability that both Jia and Yi make their shots in a single attempt is the product of their individual probabilities:\n\nP(both make) = p1 * p2 = (3/4) * (2/3) = 6/12 = 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the probability that Jia and Yi will be an excellent pair in the first round is 1/2.\n\n**Part (2): Minimum number of rounds required for 16 excellent pairs and corresponding probabilities p1 and p2.**\n\nGiven:\n- p1 + p2 = 4/3\n\nWe need to find the minimum number of rounds (n) such that the probability of having at least 16 excellent pairs is at least 1. Also, we need to find p1 and p2 that satisfy this condition.\n\nFirst, let's note that the number of excellent pairs in n rounds follows a binomial distribution. The number of excellent pairs in n rounds is a binomial random variable with parameters n and p = p1 + p2. The probability mass function for a binomial distribution is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1 - p)^(n - k)\n\nWe need to find the smallest n such that P(X >= 16) >= 1. Since the probability of having at least 16 excellent pairs is 1, we can approximate this using the normal distribution for large n. The mean μ and standard deviation σ of the binomial distribution are:\n\nμ = n * p\nσ = sqrt(n * p * (1 - p))\n\nGiven that p1 + p2 = 4/3, we can express p as (4/3) - p2. Let's denote p = (4/3) - p2. Then, μ = n * (4/3 - p2) and σ = sqrt(n * (4/3 - p2) * p2).\n\nWe need to find the smallest n such that the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the binomial distribution is at least 1 for k = 16. Since the CDF approaches 1 as k increases, we can approximate that the probability of having at least 16 excellent pairs is approximately 1 when the number of rounds is large enough.\n\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant that provides well‑reasoned but short responses.\nYou first briefly think about the reasoning process as an internal monologue and then provide the user with the answer.\nRespond in the following format:\n\nProblem: 12.

First, I need to understand the given information and what's being asked. The quadrilateral ABCD has diagonals intersecting at point O. The areas of triangles ABO and CDO are both 3/2. The length of BC is 3√2, and the cosine of angle ADC is 3/√10. We need to find the smallest possible area of such a quadrilateral.\n\nStarting with the given information. The diagonals intersect at O, so AO, BO, CO, DO are all segments of the diagonals. The areas of triangles ABO and CDO are equal, each being 3/2. This suggests that the triangles ABO and CDO are similar in some way, but since they are on different sides of the quadrilateral, their areas being equal might imply that the triangles are congruent or have some proportional relationship. However, without more information, we can't assume that. But since the problem is asking for the smallest possible area, perhaps we can model the quadrilateral as a rectangle or a parallelogram, given the given lengths and angles.\n\nGiven that BC is 3√2, which is the length of one side of the quadrilateral. The cosine of angle ADC is 3/√10. Let me recall that in a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal, and adjacent angles are supplementary. So, angle ADC is equal to angle ABC, and angle ADC + angle ABC = 180 degrees. Since angle ADC is given as 3/√10, angle ABC would be 180 - 3/√10. However, in a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary, so angle ABC would be 180 - angle ADC. But since angle ADC is given, angle ABC is 180 - 3/√10. Wait, but in a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary, so angle ABC would be 180 - angle ADC. But angle ADC is 3/√10, so angle ABC is 180 - 3/√10.

Find the smallest area that such a quadrilateral can have.\n\n<think>\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\nLet me think about this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the given information and what's being asked. The quadrilateral ABCD has diagonals intersecting at point O. The areas of triangles ABO and CDO are both 3/2. The length of BC is 3√2, and the cosine of angle ADC is 3/√10. We need to find the smallest possible area of such a quadrilateral.\n\nStarting with the given information. The diagonals intersect at O, so AO, BO, CO, DO are all segments of the diagonals. The areas of triangles ABO and CDO are equal, each being 3/2. This suggests that the triangles ABO and CDO are similar in some way, but since they are on different sides of the quadrilateral, their areas being equal might imply that the triangles are congruent or have some proportional relationship. However, without more information, we can't assume that. But since the problem is asking for the smallest possible area, perhaps we can model the quadrilateral as a rectangle or a parallelogram, given the given lengths and angles.\n\nGiven that BC is 3√2, which is the length of one side of the quadrilateral. The cosine of angle ADC is 3/√10. Let me recall that in a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal, and adjacent angles are supplementary. So, angle ADC is equal to angle ABC, and angle ADC + angle ABC = 180 degrees. Since angle ADC is given as 3/√10, angle ABC would be 180 - 3/√10. However, in a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary, so angle ABC would be 180 - angle ADC. But since angle ADC is given, angle ABC is 180 - 3/√10. Wait, but in a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary, so angle ABC would be 180 - angle ADC. But angle ADC is 3/√10, so angle ABC is 180 - 3/√10. But in a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary, so angle ABC would be 180 - angle ADC. But angle ADC is 3/√10, so angle ABC is 180 - 3/√10.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the weights. Haman is 106 pounds. His four sisters weigh 5, 5, 6, and 8 pounds. So, the total weight of the five children is 106 + 5 + 5 + 6 + 8. Let me calculate that. 106 + 5 is 111, 111 + 5 is 116, 116 + 6 is 122, and 122 + 8 is 130. So, the total weight is 130 pounds. That's the sum of all five children's weights.\n\nNow, to find the mean weight, we divide the total weight by the number of children. There are five children, so the mean is 130 divided by 5. Let me compute that. 130 divided by 5 is 26. So, the mean weight is 26 pounds.\n\nNext, let's find the median weight. The median is the middle value when the weights are arranged in order. Since there are five children, the median will be the third value in the ordered list. Let's list all the weights in order: 5, 5, 6, 8, 106. The third value is 6 pounds. So, the median weight is 6 pounds.\n\nNow, the question is asking which is larger: the median or the mean, and the difference between them. So, we need to compare 6 and 26. Clearly, 26 is larger than 6. The difference between them is 26 - 6, which is 20. So, the answer should be (B) Median, 20.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me verify the total weight again. 106 + 5 = 111, 111 + 5 = 116, 116 + 6 = 122, 122 + 8 = 130. Yes, that's correct. Then, the mean is 130 divided by 5, which is 26. The median is 6. So, 26 is indeed larger than 6, and the difference is 20. Therefore, the answer should be (B) Median, 20.\n\nSo, the final answer is (B) Median, 20. Let me just confirm that again. The total weight is 130 pounds, so the mean is 26 pounds. The median is 6 pounds. The difference is 26 - 6 = 20. So, the median is larger, and the difference is 20. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Median, 20. That's the answer. Let me check if I made any mistakes in my calculations. Hmm, no, everything checks out. So, the answer is (B) Median, 20.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem. The expression d^c + 1000 must be divisible by 10 + c. That means when we divide d^c + 1000 by 10 + c, there's no remainder. So, mathematically, d^c + 1000 ≡ 0 mod (10 + c). Therefore, d^c ≡ -1000 mod (10 + c). Since we're looking for the least positive integer d, we need to find the smallest d that satisfies this congruence for some integer c.\n\nLet me think. Since d is a positive integer, d^c must be congruent to -1000 mod (10 + c). But 10 + c is a positive integer greater than 10, so 10 + c can be 11, 12, 13, etc. So, d^c ≡ -1000 mod (10 + c). Let me note that 1000 is 10^3, so -1000 is -10^3. So, d^c ≡ -10^3 mod (10 + c). That might be useful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express this in terms of modular arithmetic. Let me denote 10 + c as k, where k is a positive integer greater than 10. Then, the congruence becomes d^c ≡ -10^3 mod k. Since k is a multiple of 10, maybe I can factor out 10 from the right-hand side? Let's see. -10^3 is -1000, which is -10*100. So, -10^3 ≡ -10*100 mod k. Therefore, d^c ≡ -10*100 mod k. But since k is a multiple of 10, maybe I can write k as 10m, where m is a positive integer. Then, -10*100 ≡ -1000 ≡ -10*100 ≡ -10*100 mod 10m. But since 10*100 is 1000, which is 10*100, so -10*100 is -10*100. Therefore, d^c ≡ -10*100 mod 10m. But 10*100 is 1000, which is 10*100. So, -10*100 is -10*100. Therefore, d^c ≡ -10*100 mod 10m. But since 10*100 is 1000, which is 10*100. So, -10*100 is -10*100. Therefore, d^c ≡ -10*100 mod 10m. But since 10*100 is 1000, which is 10*100.

Hmm, let's start by understanding what this inequality represents. It's a quadratic in terms of a, and we need it to be positive for all real numbers a in the given interval. That means the quadratic expression must be always positive, regardless of the value of a. To ensure this, the quadratic must have no real roots or, if it does, they must be complex. So, the discriminant must be less than zero. Let me recall that for a quadratic ax² + bx + c > 0 for all real a, the discriminant D must be less than zero. So, in this case, the quadratic is x² - (a + 1)x - a², so a = 1, b = -(a + 1), c = -a². Let me compute the discriminant D.\n\nThe discriminant D is given by b² - 4ac. Plugging in the values:\n\nD = [-(a + 1)]² - 4*1*(-a²) = (a + 1)² + 4a²\n\nExpanding (a + 1)²: a² + 2a + 1. Then adding 4a²:\n\na² + 2a + 1 + 4a² = 5a² + 2a + 1\n\nSo, D = 5a² + 2a + 1. For the quadratic to be always positive, D must be less than zero:\n\n5a² + 2a + 1 < 0\n\nBut a is in the interval (1, 2). Let me check if this inequality holds for a in (1, 2). Let's see:\n\nFirst, let's check the value of D at a = 1:\n\n5*(1)² + 2*(1) + 1 = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8. So D is 8 when a = 1, which is positive. Then, as a increases from 1 to 2, the quadratic 5a² + 2a + 1 will increase because the coefficient of a² is positive. Let's check at a = 2:\n\n5*(2)² + 2*(2) + 1 = 20 + 4 + 1 = 25. So D is 25 when a = 2, which is also positive. Therefore, D is positive for all a in (1, 2). Therefore, the quadratic 5a² + 2a + 1 is always positive for a in (1, 2). Therefore, the original inequality x² - (a + 1)x - a² > 0 must hold for all a in (1, 2). Since the quadratic in a is always positive, the inequality x² - (a + 1)x - a² > 0 must hold for all real x.

Therefore, the original inequality x² - (a + 1)x - a² > 0 must hold for all a in (1, 2). Since the quadratic in a is always positive, the inequality x² - (a + 1)x - a² > 0 must hold for all real x.

Let me start by visualizing the square ABCD. Since it's a unit square, each side is 1 unit long. Points E and F trisect AB, so AE is less than AF. Similarly, G and H trisect BC, so BG is less than BH. Then I bisect CD and DA, so I and J are the midpoints. Then HJ and EI meet at K, and GJ and FI meet at L. Hmm, this seems like a geometry problem involving intersections of lines and midpoints. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me assign coordinates to the square. Let's place point A at (0,0), B at (1,0), C at (1,1), and D at (0,1). Then, E and F trisect AB. Since AB is from (0,0) to (1,0), E is at (0,1/3) and F is at (1,1/3). Similarly, G and H trisect BC. BC is from (1,0) to (1,1), so G is at (1,1/3) and H is at (1,2/3). Then I and J bisect CD and DA. CD is from (0,1) to (1,1), so I is at (0.5,1). DA is from (0,0) to (0,1), so J is at (0,0.5). Then, HJ and EI meet at K, and GJ and FI meet at L. So, K is the intersection of HJ and EI, and L is the intersection of GJ and FI. I need to find the coordinates of K and L, then compute the distance KL.\n\nLet me start by finding the equations of lines HJ and EI. First, H is (1,2/3) and J is (0,0.5). The slope of HJ is (0.5 - 2/3)/(0 - 1) = (3/6 - 4/6)/(-1) = (-1/6)/(-1) = 1/6. So, the equation of line HJ is y - 2/3 = (1/6)(x - 1). Let me write that as y = (1/6)x + (2/3 - 1/6) = (1/6)x + (4/6 - 1/6) = (1/6)x + 1/2.\n\nNext, E is (0,1/3) and I is (0.5,1). The slope of EI is (1 - 1/3)/(0.5 - 0) = (2/3)/0.5 = (2/3)/1/2 = 4/3. So, the equation of line EI is y - 1/3 = (4/3)(x - 0) = (4/3)x. Let me write that as y = (4/3)x + 1/3.\n\nNow, to find the intersection point K of HJ and EI.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem. The equation is symmetric in x and y, so maybe there's a symmetry here. Also, z is the greatest common divisor, so both x and y must be multiples of z. Let me denote z as d, so x = d * a and y = d * b where a and b are coprime integers (since d is the gcd). Then, substituting into the equation:\n\nd * a + d * b² + d³ = d * a * d * b * d\n\nSimplifying the right side: d³ * a * b * d = d⁴ * a * b\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\nd * a + d * b² + d³ = d⁴ * a * b\n\nDivide both sides by d (since d is positive, this is valid):\n\na + b² + d² = d³ * a * b\n\nNow, let's rearrange this equation:\n\na + b² + d² = d³ * a * b\n\nLet me see if I can factor this equation.

Marco starts by coloring one cell black and all others white. Then, Vera can perform actions exactly k times, each time swapping two neighboring cells. The goal is to find the minimal k (m) such that Vera can guarantee a win, and then find the smallest t where she can do so in at most t turns. The answer is supposed to be 100m + t. Hmm, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, let's understand the game mechanics. Marco starts with one black cell and all others white. Each turn, he can choose a black cell with more than two white neighbors and turn it white, while turning all its neighbors black. Then, Vera can swap two neighboring cells. The key here is that Vera can only swap two cells, so each swap operation is a single move. The question is about the minimal number of such moves (k) that Vera can perform to ensure she can always win, regardless of Marco's moves.\n\nThe problem states that for k=m, t is the minimal positive integer such that Vera can guarantee a win after at most t turns. So, we need to find m and t, then compute 100m + t. Let me try to figure out what m is first.\n\nLet me think about the minimal k. If k=1, Vera can only swap two cells once. But since Marco can choose a black cell with more than two white neighbors, he might be able to block Vera's moves. For example, if Marco has a black cell with three white neighbors, Vera can't swap two neighboring cells because she can't swap two cells that are neighbors. So, k=1 isn't enough. Let's see if k=2 is possible.\n\nIf k=2, Vera can perform two swaps. But even with two swaps, she might not be able to guarantee a win. For example, if Marco has a black cell with three white neighbors, and Vera swaps two neighboring cells, she might not be able to turn that black cell white. So, k=2 isn't enough either. Let's try k=3.\n\nIf k=3, Vera can perform three swaps. Hmm, maybe this is possible. Let me think. If Marco has a black cell with three white neighbors, Vera can swap two neighboring cells, which might turn that black cell white. Then, the next swap might turn another black cell white, and so on. But how does this work?\n\nLet me model the grid. Let's assume the grid is infinite, so we can think of it as a graph where each cell is a node, and edges connect neighboring cells.

Vera's move is to swap two neighboring cells.\n\nLet me consider a small example. Suppose the grid is a 3x3 grid. Marco starts with one black cell in the center. Let's label the cells as follows:\n\n```\n1 2 3\n4 5 6\n7 8 9\n```\n\nMarco's move: He can choose cell 5 (the center) and turn it white.

Marco and Vera play a game on an infinite grid of square cells. At the beginning, only one cell is black and the rest are white. \n\tA turn in this game consists of the following. Marco moves first, and for every move he must choose a cell which is black and which has more than two white neighbors. (Two cells are neighbors if they share an edge, so every cell has exactly four neighbors.) His move consists of making the chosen black cell white and turning all of its neighbors black if they are not already. Vera then performs the following action exactly $k$ times: she chooses two cells that are neighbors to each other and swaps their colors (she is allowed to swap the colors of two white or of two black cells, though doing so has no effect). This, in totality, is a single turn. If Vera leaves the board so that Marco cannot choose a cell that is black and has more than two white neighbors, then Vera wins; otherwise, another turn occurs.\n\tLet $m$ be the minimal $k$ value such that Vera can guarantee that she wins no matter what Marco does.

Compute $100m + t$.\n\n[i]Proposed by Ashwin Sah[/i]\n\n<think>\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\n<think>\nAlright, so the problem is about a game between Marco and Vera on an infinite grid. Marco starts by coloring one cell black and all others white. Then, Vera can perform actions exactly k times, each time swapping two neighboring cells. The goal is to find the minimal k (m) such that Vera can guarantee a win, and then find the smallest t where she can do so in at most t turns. The answer is supposed to be 100m + t. Hmm, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, let's understand the game mechanics. Marco starts with one black cell and all others white. Each turn, he can choose a black cell with more than two white neighbors and turn it white, while turning all its neighbors black. Then, Vera can swap two neighboring cells. The key here is that Vera can only swap two cells, so each swap operation is a single move. The question is about the minimal number of such moves (k) that Vera can perform to ensure she can always win, regardless of Marco's moves.\n\nThe problem states that for k=m, t is the minimal positive integer such that Vera can guarantee a win after at most t turns. So, we need to find m and t, then compute 100m + t. Let me try to figure out what m is first.\n\nLet me think about the minimal k. If k=1, Vera can only swap two cells once. But since Marco can choose a black cell with more than two white neighbors, he might be able to block Vera's moves. For example, if Marco has a black cell with three white neighbors, Vera can't swap two neighboring cells because she can't swap two cells that are neighbors. So, k=1 isn't enough. Let's see if k=2 is possible.\n\nIf k=2, Vera can perform two swaps. But even with two swaps, she might not be able to guarantee a win. For example, if Marco has a black cell with three white neighbors, and Vera swaps two neighboring cells, she might not be able to turn that black cell white. So, k=2 isn't enough either. Let's try k=3.\n\nIf k=3, Vera can perform three swaps. Hmm, maybe this is possible. Let me think.

Hmm, let me start by recalling some properties of right triangles and medians.\n\nFirst, in a right triangle, the median to the hypotenuse is half the length of the hypotenuse. That makes sense because the median of a triangle connects a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. In this case, CD is the median on hypotenuse AB, so CD = (1/2)AB. Also, since it's a right triangle, the legs AC and BC are perpendicular to each other, and the hypotenuse AB is the longest side.\n\nNow, the inradius of a triangle is the radius of the inscribed circle, which touches all three sides. The formula for the inradius r of a triangle is r = A/s, where A is the area and s is the semiperimeter. So, for triangle ABC, the inradius r is A/[(AC + BC + AB)/2].\n\nSimilarly, for triangle ACD, which is a right triangle with legs AC and CD, and hypotenuse AD.

The inradius r2 of triangle BCD is A2/s2, where A2 is the area of BCD and s2 is its semiperimeter.\n\nThe problem states that r1 + r2 ≥ k r. So, I need to express r1 and r2 in terms of the sides of triangle ABC and then find the maximum k such that this inequality holds.\n\nLet me denote the sides of triangle ABC as follows: AC = a, BC = b, AB = c. Since it's a right triangle, c is the hypotenuse, so c = sqrt(a² + b²). The inradius r of triangle ABC is (a + b + c)/2.\n\nNow, triangle ACD is a right triangle with legs AC = a and CD = (1/2)c, and hypotenuse AD. The inradius r1 of triangle ACD can be calculated as (1/2)(AC + CD + AD)/2. But since CD is (1/2)c, and AD is the hypotenuse of triangle ACD, which is sqrt(a² + (1/2)c²). Therefore, the semiperimeter s1 of triangle ACD is (a + CD + AD)/2 = (a + (1/2)c + sqrt(a² + (1/2)c²))/2.\n\nSimilarly, triangle BCD is a right triangle with legs BC = b and CD = (1/2)c, and hypotenuse BD. The inradius r2 of triangle BCD is (1/2)(BC + CD + BD)/2. BD is the hypotenuse of triangle BCD, which is sqrt(b² + (1/2)c²). So, the semiperimeter s2 of triangle BCD is (b + CD + BD)/2 = (b + (1/2)c + sqrt(b² + (1/2)c²))/2.\n\nTherefore, the sum r1 + r2 is:\n\n(1/2)(a + CD + AD) + (1/2)(b + CD + BD) = (a + b +\n\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant that provides well‑reasoned but short responses.\nYou first briefly think about the reasoning process as an internal monologue and then provide the user with the answer.\nRespond in the following format:\n\nProblem: In Rt $\\triangle A B C$, $\\angle C=90^{\\circ}$, $C D$ is the median on the hypotenuse $A B$.

Hmm, let me start by recalling some properties of right triangles and medians.\n\nFirst, in a right triangle, the median to the hypotenuse is half the length of the hypotenuse. That makes sense because the median of a triangle connects a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. In this case, CD is the median on hypotenuse AB, so CD = (1/2)AB. Also, since it's a right triangle, the legs AC and BC are perpendicular to each other, and the hypotenuse AB is the longest side.\n\nNow, the inradius of a triangle is the radius of the inscribed circle, which touches all three sides. The formula for the inradius r of a triangle is r = A/s, where A is the area and s is the semiperimeter. So, for triangle ABC, the inradius r is A/[(AC + BC + AB)/2].\n\nSimilarly, for triangle ACD, which is a right triangle with legs AC and CD, and hypotenuse AD. The inradius r1 of triangle ACD can be calculated as A1/s1, where A1 is the area of ACD and s1 is its semiperimeter.\n\nTriangle BCD is also a right triangle with legs BC and CD, and hypotenuse BD. The inradius r2 of triangle BCD is A2/s2, where A2 is the area of BCD and s2 is its semiperimeter.\n\nThe problem states that r1 + r2 ≥ k r. So, I need to express r1 and r2 in terms of the sides of triangle ABC and then find the maximum k such that this inequality holds.\n\nLet me denote the sides of triangle ABC as follows: AC = a, BC = b, AB = c. Since it's a right triangle, c is the hypotenuse, so c = sqrt(a² + b²). The inradius r of triangle ABC is (a + b + c)/2.\n\nNow, triangle ACD is a right triangle with legs AC = a and CD = (1/2)c, and hypotenuse AD. The inradius r1 of triangle ACD can be calculated as (1/2)(AC + CD + AD)/2. But since CD is (1/2)c, and AD is the hypotenuse of triangle ACD, which is sqrt(a² + (1/2)c²). Therefore, the semiperimeter s1 of triangle ACD is (a + CD + AD)/2 = (a + (1/2)c + sqrt(a² + (1/2)c²))/2.\n\nSimilarly, triangle BCD is a right triangle with legs BC = b and CD = (1/2)c, and hypotenuse BD. The inradius r2 of triangle BCD is (1/2)(BC + CD + BD)/2. BD is the hypotenuse of triangle BCD, which is sqrt(b² + (1/2)c²). So, the semiperimeter s2 of triangle BCD is (b + CD + BD)/2 = (b + (1/2)c + sqrt(b² + (1/2)c²))/2.\n\nTherefore, the sum r1 + r2 is:\n\n(1/2)(a + CD + AD) + (1/2)(b + CD + BD) = (a + b +\n\n<answer>\nThe maximum value of k is 2. Let me verify this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall that in a right triangle, the median to the hypotenuse is half the hypotenuse. So, in triangle ABC, CD is the median to hypotenuse AB, hence CD = (1/2)AB. Since AB is the hypotenuse, AB = c. Therefore, CD = c/2.\n\nNow, let's compute the inradii of the three triangles: ABC, ACD, and BCD.\n\nFor triangle", "e71c071_correct": false}

Let me place point A at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Since AD is perpendicular to AB, AD is vertical. Let me denote the coordinates of point A as (0,0), B as (3,0), D as (0,h), and C as (3, h), where h is the height of the trapezoid. Wait, but BC is 5 units long, so the distance from B to C is 5. Let me check that. BC is from (3,0) to (3, h), so the length is h. But BC is given as 5, so h=5. So point C is at (3,5). Then point D is at (0,5), which is 5 units above A.

So the equation of MC is y = √3x - √3/8.\n\nSimilarly\n\n<answer>\nThe problem involves an equilateral triangle ABC with M and N as midpoints of AC and AB respectively. Points P and Q are on MC and NB respectively, and R and S are the orthocenters of triangles ABP and ACQ. The lines BP and CQ intersect at T, and we need to find all possible values of angle BCQ such that triangle RST is equilateral.\n\nFirst, let's assign coordinates to the triangle. Let's place point A at (0,0), point B at (1,0), and point C at (0.5, √3/2). This makes the triangle equilateral with side length 1.\n\nMidpoint M of AC is (0.25, √3/4), and midpoint N of AB is (0.5, 0). Points P is on MC, so its coordinates can be parameterized as (0.25 + t(0.5 - 0.25), √3/4 + t(0 - √3/4)) = (0.25 + 0.25t, √3/4 - 0.25t), where t is a parameter between", "e71c071_correct": false}

The problem states that point P1(3, a) is symmetric to point P2(b, -2) with respect to the x-axis. Symmetry with respect to the x-axis means that the x-coordinates remain the same, but the y-coordinates are negated. So, if P1 is symmetric to P2, then the x-coordinate of P1 should be equal to the x-coordinate of P2, and the y-coordinate of P1 should be the negative of the y-coordinate of P2. Let me write that down:\n\nFor the x-coordinates: 3 = b\nFor the y-coordinates: a = -(-2) = 2\n\nSo, from the symmetry with respect to the x-axis, we can determine that b = 3 and a = 2. Therefore, the coordinates of point P1 are (3, 2). Now, the problem asks for the coordinates of the point symmetric to P1 with respect to the y-axis and the origin. Let me recall that the symmetry with respect to the y-axis is such that the x-coordinate changes sign, and the y-coordinate remains the same. Similarly, symmetry with respect to the origin is such that both coordinates change sign.\n\nFirst, let's find the point symmetric to P1(3, 2) with respect to the y-axis. The x-coordinate will be -3, and the y-coordinate will remain 2. So, the coordinates are (-3, 2). Now, let's find the point symmetric to P1(3, 2) with respect to the origin. The x-coordinate will be -3, and the y-coordinate will be -2. So, the coordinates are (-3, -2). Therefore, the answers are:\n\nFor the point symmetric to P1 with respect to the y-axis: (-3, 2)\n\nFor the point symmetric to P1 with respect to the origin: (-3, -2)\n\nTherefore, the values of a and b are 2 and 3, respectively, and the coordinates of the points are (-3, 2) and (-3, -2). Let me check if that makes sense. If P1 is (3, 2), then symmetric to the y-axis would be (-3, 2), and symmetric to the origin would be (-3, -2). That seems correct. So, the final answer is:\n\na = 2, b = 3, coordinates of the point symmetric to P1 with respect to the y-axis: (-3, 2), coordinates with respect to the origin: (-3, -2)\n</answer>\n\nThe answer is: a = 2, b = 3, coordinates of the point symmetric to P1 with respect to the y-axis: (-3, 2), coordinates with respect to the origin: (-3, -2)You are a helpful AI assistant.

The parametric equations given are x = 4 - cosθ and y = 1 - sinθ, where 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2. I need to figure out what kind of graph these parametric equations represent. Let me start by understanding what these equations mean.\n\nFirst, let's consider the range of θ. The problem states that 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2. So, θ is between 0 and π/2 radians, which is equivalent to 0° to 90°. This is a quarter-circle in the first quadrant of the coordinate plane.\n\nNow, let's analyze the parametric equations. The x-coordinate is given by 4 - cosθ. Since cosθ ranges from 0 to 1 when θ is between 0 and π/2, the x-coordinate will range from 4 - 1 = 3 to 4 - 0 = 4. So, x ranges from 3 to 4.\n\nSimilarly, the y-coordinate is given by 1 - sinθ. Since sinθ ranges from 0 to 1 when θ is between 0 and π/2, the y-coordinate will range from 1 - 1 = 0 to 1 - 0 = 1. So, y ranges from 0 to 1.\n\nTherefore, the parametric equations describe a line segment connecting the points (3, 0) and (4, 1). Let me verify this.\n\nWhen θ = 0, x = 4 - cos0 = 4 - 1 = 3, y = 1 - sin0 = 1 - 0 = 1. So, the starting point is (3, 1).\n\nWhen θ = π/2, x = 4 - cos(π/2) = 4 - 0 = 4, y = 1 - sin(π/2) = 1 - 1 = 0. So, the ending point is (4, 0).\n\nTherefore, the line segment connects (3, 1) to (4, 0). Let me check if this line segment is part of a circle, ellipse, or something else.\n\nLooking at the parametric equations, we can eliminate the parameter θ to find the Cartesian equation. Let's do that.\n\nFrom x = 4 - cosθ, we can write cosθ = 4 - x. Similarly, from y = 1 - sinθ, we can write sinθ = 1 - y.\n\nNow, using the Pythagorean identity, cos²θ + sin²θ = 1.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the sum of the digits of a number is congruent to the number itself modulo 9. That's because 10 is congruent to 1 modulo 9, so each digit contributes to the total sum. So, if the sum of the digits of n is 100, then n ≡ 100 mod 9. Similarly, 44n ≡ 800 mod 9. Then, 3n ≡ 3*100 mod 9. So, the key here is to find 3*100 mod 9 and then use that to find the sum of the digits of 3n.\n\nLet me compute 3*100 mod 9. 100 divided by 9 is 11 with a remainder of 1, so 100 ≡ 1 mod 9. Therefore, 3*100 ≡ 3*1 ≡ 3 mod 9. So, 3n ≡ 3 mod 9. Therefore, the sum of the digits of 3n is congruent to 3 mod 9. But we need the sum of the digits of 3n, which is 3 mod 9. So, the sum of the digits of 3n is 3.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Let's see, if n is a number with digits summing to 100, then 3n would be 3 times that sum. Since 3*100 is 300, and 300 divided by 9 is 33 with a remainder of 3, so 300 ≡ 3 mod 9. Therefore, 3n ≡ 3 mod 9. So, the sum of the digits of 3n is 3. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the modulo calculation. Let's verify:\n\nFirst, 100 mod 9 is 1, so 3*100 = 300.

Hmm, let me recall how to approach such problems. Since it's a quadratic function, I remember that the minimum or maximum value occurs at the vertex. For a quadratic equation in the form ax² + bx + c, the x-coordinate of the vertex is given by x = -b/(2a). So, in this case, the coefficient of x² is 1, and the coefficient of x is 8. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, the x-coordinate of the vertex is (-8)/(2*1) = -8/2 = -4. So, the vertex is at x = -4. To find the minimum value, I need to plug x = -4 into the original expression. Let me do that calculation.\n\nx² + 8x becomes (-4)² + 8*(-4). Let me compute each term. (-4) squared is 16, and 8 times -4 is -32. So, adding those together: 16 - 32 = -16. Therefore, the minimum value is -16. But wait, let me check if this is one of the options. The options are given as A) -16.25, B) -16, C) -15, D) -8, and E) None of these. So, -16 is option B. But let me verify again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can complete the square to find the minimum value. Completing the square is another way to find the vertex of a quadratic equation. Let's try that.\n\nStarting with x² + 8x. To complete the square, I need to add and subtract the square of half the coefficient of x. The coefficient of x is 8, so half of that is 4, and squaring that gives 16. So, adding and subtracting 16 inside the expression:\n\nx² + 8x + 16 - 16. Now, the first three terms form a perfect square: (x + 4)² - 16. So, the expression becomes (x + 4)² - 16. The minimum value of (x + 4)² is 0, which occurs when x = -4. Therefore, the minimum value of the original expression is -16. That matches option B. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, using calculus. The derivative of x² + 8x is 2x + 8. Setting this derivative equal to zero to find critical points: 2x + 8 = 0 => x = -4. Then, evaluating the function at x = -4: (-4)² + 8*(-4) = 16 - 32 = -16. Yep, same result. So, both methods confirm that the minimum value is -16. Therefore, the answer should be B) -16.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are A) -16.25, B) -16, C) -15, D) -8, and E) None of these. So, -16 is option B.

To complete the square, I need to add and subtract the square of half the coefficient of x. The coefficient of x is 8, so half of that is 4, and squaring that gives 16. So, adding and subtracting 16 inside the expression:\n\nx² + 8x + 16 - 16. Now, the first three terms form a perfect square: (x + 4)² - 16. So, the expression becomes (x + 4)² - 16. The minimum value of (x + 4)² is 0, which occurs when x = -4. Therefore, the minimum value of the original expression is -16. That matches option B. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, using calculus. The derivative of x² + 8x is 2x + 8. Setting this derivative equal to zero to find critical points: 2x + 8 = 0 => x = -4. Then, evaluating the function at x = -4: (-4)² + 8*(-4) = 16 - 32 = -16. Yep, same result. So, both methods confirm that the minimum value is -16. Therefore, the answer should be B) -16.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are A) -16.25, B) -16, C) -15, D) -8, and E) None of these. So, -16 is option B. But the answer key says E) None of these. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.\n\nStarting with x² + 8x. Completing the square: (x + 4)² -\n\n<answer>\nThe smallest value of x² + 8x for real values of x is -16. Therefore, the answer is B) -16.\n</answer>You are a helpful AI assistant that provides well-reasoned but short responses. When answering questions, please consider the following guidelines:\n\n1.

A tetrahedron is a polyhedron with four triangular faces, four vertices, and six edges. To determine the maximum number of planes of symmetry, we need to consider all possible planes that can divide the tetrahedron into two congruent parts.\n\nFirst, let's recall that a plane of symmetry of a polyhedron is a plane that divides the polyhedron into two congruent parts. For a tetrahedron, each plane of symmetry must pass through the center of the tetrahedron and bisect all edges and faces. The number of such planes depends on the symmetry of the tetrahedron.\n\nA regular tetrahedron has all edges of equal length and all faces congruent. However, the problem does not specify whether the tetrahedron is regular or not. If it is regular, then the maximum number of planes of symmetry is 7. If it is not regular, the maximum number of planes of symmetry is 6. But since the problem does not specify, we need to consider both possibilities.\n\nLet's first consider the regular tetrahedron. In a regular tetrahedron, all edges are of equal length, and all faces are equilateral triangles. The center of the tetrahedron is equidistant from all vertices. Any plane that passes through the center and bisects all edges and faces will be a plane of symmetry. Since a regular tetrahedron has 4 vertices, 6 edges, and 4 faces, each edge is bisected by the plane of symmetry. Therefore, there are 4 planes that pass through the center and bisect all edges, and 4 planes that pass through the center and bisect all faces. However, some of these planes might coincide, so we need to count them without double-counting.\n\nTo find the number of distinct planes of symmetry, we can use the fact that the number of planes of symmetry in a polyhedron is equal to the number of edges that are bisected by the planes of symmetry. For a regular tetrahedron, each edge is bisected by the plane of symmetry. Therefore, the number of planes of symmetry is equal to the number of edges, which is 4. However, this is only possible if the tetrahedron is regular. If it is not regular, the number of planes of symmetry is less than 4.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where the tetrahedron is not regular. In this case, the number of planes of symmetry is less than 4. To find the maximum number of planes of symmetry, we need to consider the maximum number of planes that can bisect all edges and faces. Since a tetrahedron has 6 edges and 4 faces, each edge is bisected by the plane of symmetry. Therefore, the maximum number of planes of symmetry is 6, which occurs when the tetrahedron is not regular but has the maximum number of planes that can bisect all edges and faces.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of planes of symmetry a tetrahedron can have is 7, which occurs when the tetrahedron is regular. If it is not regular, the maximum number of planes of symmetry is 6.\n\n</answer>\n\nThe maximum number of planes of symmetry a tetrahedron can have is 7.

Hmm, let me think. Since x and y are positive reals, maybe I can use some algebraic manipulation to simplify this equation. Let me start by letting me set variables for x and y. Let me denote x/y as t. So, t is a positive real number. Then, x = t*y. Let me substitute that into the equation.\n\nFirst, let's compute x²/y² and y²/x². Since x = t*y, then x² = t²*y². Therefore, x²/y² = t². Similarly, y²/x² = 1/t². So, the first term becomes t² + 1/t². Then, the second term is x/y + y/x. Since x = t*y, x/y = t. Similarly, y/x = 1/t. So, x/y + y/x = t + 1/t.

A table of values of a known function $f(n)$ for natural values of $n$ has been compiled; it turned out that the second difference is constantly equal to zero.

The question is asking for a formula that represents f(n) for any natural number n, and how the situation changes for fractional values of n.\n\nFirst, let's recall that the second difference of a sequence is the difference between consecutive differences. If the second difference is constant, then the sequence is a quadratic function. Quadratic functions can be represented by a formula of the form f(n) = an² + bn + c, where a, b, and c are constants.\n\nTo find the coefficients a, b, and c, we can use the given table of values.

For fractional values of n, the situation is similar. Since the second difference is constant, the function is still quadratic, but the coefficients a, b, and c would need to be determined using the given table. The formula would be f(n) = an² + bn + c, where a, b, and c are found by solving the system of equations derived from the table. The situation for fractional values of n is the same as for natural numbers, as quadratic functions are defined for all real numbers, including fractions.\n</answer>", "e71c071_correct": false}

Hmm, functional equations can be tricky, but maybe I can approach this by considering specific values for x and y to see if I can deduce something about the function f.\n\nFirst, let's try plugging in x = 1. Since x is a positive rational number, 1 is a positive rational number. Let's set x = 1. Then the equation becomes f(1²(f(y))²) = (f(1))² f(y). Simplifying the left side, that's f(f(y)²) = f(1)² f(y). Let me denote f(1) as c, so the equation becomes f(c² y²) = c² f(y). This seems like a functional equation in terms of y.

Similarly, from equation 2, if I set x = 1, then f(c²) = c² f(1) = c² c = c³. So f(c²) = c³. Therefore, f(c²) = c³ for all positive rational numbers c. So f(c²) = c³ for all positive rational c. But c² is a positive rational number, so c² is a positive rational number. Therefore, f(c²) = c³. But c² is a positive rational number, so c² is a positive rational number. Therefore, f(c²) = c³. So f(c²) = c³ for all positive rational c. Therefore, f(c²) = c³ for all positive rational c. Therefore, f(c²) = c³ for all positive rational c. Therefore, f(c²) = c³ for all positive rational c.

Let me recall how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the area of a triangle can be calculated using vectors. If I have two vectors originating from the same point, say OA and OB, then the area of triangle AOB can be found by taking the magnitude of the cross product of OA and OB divided by 2. Similarly, the area of triangle AOC can be found by taking the magnitude of the cross product of OA and OC divided by 2.

The problem involves an acute triangle ABC that is not isosceles. The intersection point K is the intersection of the angle bisector of angle ACB with the perpendicular bisector of side AB. The line CK intersects the altitudes from vertices A and B at points P and Q respectively. It's given that triangles AKP and BKQ have the same area. We need to determine the measure of angle ACB.\n\nFirst, let me recall some properties of triangles. In any triangle, the angle bisector theorem states that the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides. Also, the perpendicular bisector of a side of a triangle passes through the midpoint of that side and is perpendicular to it. The altitudes of a triangle are the perpendiculars dropped from each vertex to the opposite side.\n\nGiven that triangle ABC is acute and not isosceles, let me note that the angle bisector of angle ACB is the line that divides angle ACB into two equal parts. The perpendicular bisector of AB is the line that is perpendicular to AB and passes through its midpoint. The intersection point K is the intersection of these two lines.

The problem involves an acute triangle ABC that is not isosceles. The intersection point K is the intersection of the angle bisector of angle ACB with the perpendicular bisector of side AB. The line CK intersects the altitudes from vertices A and B at points P and Q respectively. It's given that triangles AKP and BKQ have the same area. We need to determine the measure of angle ACB.\n\nFirst, let me recall some properties of triangles. In any triangle, the angle bisector theorem states that the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides. Also, the perpendicular bisector of a side of a triangle passes through the midpoint of that side and is perpendicular to it. The altitudes of a triangle are the perpendiculars dropped from each vertex to the opposite side.\n\nGiven that triangle ABC is acute and not isosceles, let me note that the angle bisector of angle ACB is the line that divides angle ACB into two equal parts. The perpendicular bisector of AB is the line that is perpendicular to AB and passes through its midpoint. The intersection point K is the intersection of these two lines. The line CK intersects the altitudes from A and B at points P and Q respectively. The areas of triangles AKP and BKQ are equal.\n\nSince the triangle is acute, all angles are less than 90 degrees.

Maybe I can use those formulas here.\n\nFirst, let's recall the sum-to-product identities. The sum of sines is equal to 2 sin[(α + β)/2] cos[(α - β)/2], and the sum of cosines is 2 cos[(α + β)/2] sin[(α - β)/2]. That seems promising. Let me write that down:\n\nsin α + sin β = 2 sin[(α + β)/2] cos[(α - β)/2]\n\ncos α + cos β = 2 cos[(α + β)/2] sin[(α - β)/2]\n\nSo, if I can express sin(α + β) and cos(α + β) in terms of p and q, maybe I can solve for them. Let me denote α + β as θ. Then, sin θ = p and cos θ = q. So, θ is the angle whose sine is p and cosine is q. That's a right triangle with sides p and q, so the hypotenuse would be sqrt(p² + q²). Therefore, sin θ = p / sqrt(p² + q²) and cos θ = q / sqrt(p² + q²). But wait, θ is the angle between α and β. So, α and β are the two angles in a triangle, so α + β + γ = 180°, where γ is the third angle. But since we're dealing with α + β, which is θ, and we know that sin θ = p and cos θ = q, maybe we can use the identity sin(α + β) = sin θ and cos(α + β) = cos θ. But wait, sin θ and cos θ are the sine and cosine of θ, which is the angle between α and β. So, sin(α + β) = sin θ = p, and cos(α + β) = cos θ = q. But that seems straightforward.

For any equation of the form a * b + b, where a and b are consecutive numbers, we can factor out b. Let me try that. Let's take equation (1):\n\n992 * 999 + 999\n\nHere, 999 is the second number, and 992 is the first number.

Let me start by understanding the problem. The motorcyclist is traveling from city A to city B. If he goes at 50 km/h, he arrives one hour earlier than the scheduled time. If he goes at 35 km/h, he's two hours late. Hmm, okay. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, let's define some variables. Let's say the distance between A and B is D kilometers. Let's denote the scheduled time as T hours. So, the motorcyclist's scheduled arrival time is T hours after he starts. If he travels at 50 km/h, he arrives one hour earlier. That means he takes T - 1 hours to cover the distance D. So, the time taken at 50 km/h is D / 50 hours. Therefore, D / 50 = T - 1. Similarly, if he travels at 35 km/h, he's two hours late. So, he takes T + 2 hours to cover D. Therefore, D / 35 = T + 2. So, we have two equations:\n\n1. D / 50 = T - 1\n2. D / 35 = T + 2\n\nOur goal is to find D. So, I need to solve these two equations for D. Let me write them down again:\n\nD / 50 = T - 1\nD / 35 = T + 2\n\nTo eliminate T, I can subtract the second equation from the first. Let's do that:\n\n(D / 50) - (D / 35) = (T - 1) - (T + 2)\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\n(D / 50) - (D / 35) = (35D - 50D) / (50*35) = (-15D) / (1750) = -3D / 350\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n(T - 1) - (T + 2) = -3\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n-3D / 350 = -3\n\nMultiply both sides by 350 to get rid of the denominator:\n\n-3D = -3 * 350\n\nSimplify:\n\n-3D = -1050\n\nDivide both sides by -3:\n\nD = 1050 / 3 = 350\n\nSo, the distance between A and B is 350 km. Let me check if this makes sense. If the motorcyclist travels at 50 km/h, he should take 350 / 50 = 7 hours. Scheduled time is 8 hours, so 1 hour earlier. If he travels at 35 km/h, he should take 350 / 35 = 10 hours. Scheduled time is 8 hours, so 2 hours late. That seems correct. So, the answer should be 350 km. Let me verify with the original equations.\n\nFirst equation: 350 / 50 = 7, which is 8 - 1 = 7. Correct.\n\nSecond equation: 350 / 35 = 10, which is 8 + 2 = 10. Correct.\n\nYes, that checks out.

Hmm, derivatives of inverse trigonometric functions can be a bit tricky, but I remember that the derivative of arctg(u) is 1/(1 + u²) * du/dx. So maybe I can use that here. Let me check if u is equal to √(1 - x)/(1 - √x). Let me see.\n\nFirst, let's confirm that u is indeed √(1 - x)/(1 - √x). Let's compute the derivative of the denominator to see if it's equal to the numerator. The denominator is (1 - √x). Let's differentiate that with respect to x.\n\nThe derivative of 1 is 0, and the derivative of -√x is -1/(2√x). So the derivative of the denominator is 0 - 1/(2√x) = -1/(2√x). Therefore, the derivative of the denominator is -1/(2√x). So the derivative of the denominator is -1/(2√x). Therefore, the derivative of the denominator is -1/(2√x). Therefore, the derivative of the denominator is -1/(2√x). Therefore, the derivative of the denominator is -1/(2√x). Therefore, the derivative of the denominator is -1/(2√x).

Hmm, let's see. The integral seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it by using substitution. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, I notice that the numerator is 3 tan²x - 1, and the denominator is tan²x + 5. Maybe I can express the numerator in terms of the denominator. Let me see. If I let u = tan x, then du/dx = sec²x, so du = sec²x dx. But sec²x is equal to 1 + tan²x, so du = (1 + tan²x) dx. That's a bit tricky because the denominator is tan²x + 5, which is 1 + tan²x. So maybe I can write the numerator as 3(1 + tan²x) - 1 = 3 tan²x + 3 - 1 = 3 tan²x + 2. So the integral becomes ∫ (3 tan²x + 2)/(tan²x + 5) dx.\n\nHmm, that's better. Now, the denominator is tan²x + 5, which is 1 + tan²x. So the integral is ∫ (3 tan²x + 2)/(1 + tan²x) dx. Let me split this into two integrals: ∫ (3 tan²x)/(1 + tan²x) dx + ∫ (2)/(1 + tan²x) dx.\n\nLet me handle each part separately. Let's start with the first integral: ∫ (3 tan²x)/(1 + tan²x) dx. Let me set v = tan x, so dv = sec²x dx. Then, 1 + tan²x = v² + 1, so the integral becomes ∫ (3v²)/(v² + 1) dv. Let me factor out 3: 3 ∫ v²/(v² + 1) dv. Now, this is a standard integral. Let's divide numerator and denominator by v²: 3 ∫ (1 + 1/v²) dv. So, 3 ∫ 1 dv + 3 ∫ 1/v² dv. The first part is 3v, and the second part is 3*(-1/v) = -3/v. So the first integral is 3v - 3/v + C₁.\n\nNow, let's handle the second integral: ∫ (2)/(1 + tan²x) dx. Since 1 + tan²x = sec²x, this integral becomes ∫ 2 sec²x dx. Let me use substitution here. Let u = sec x, so du = sec x tan x dx. Then, 2 sec²x dx = 2 du. So the integral becomes 2 ∫ du = 2u + C₂. Since u = sec x, this is 2 sec x + C₂.\n\nNow, combining both parts, the integral is 3v - 3/v + 2 sec x + C, where C is the constant of integration. But remember that v = tan x, so substitute back: 3 tan x - 3/tan x + 2 sec x + C. Let me write that out:\n\n3 tan x - 3/cot x + 2 sec x + C.

The circle O is x² + y² = 4, and the curve C is y = 3|x - t|. Points A and B are on curve C, with coordinates m, n and s, p respectively, where m, n, s, p are positive integers. The ratio k is constant, so maybe I can set up an equation involving distances and solve for t.\n\nFirst, let me recall that the ratio of distances from any point on the circle to points A and B is constant. So, for any point (x, y) on the circle, the ratio |OA| / |OB| = k. Since OA is the distance from (x, y) to A(m, n), and OB is the distance from (x, y) to B(s, p). Therefore, |OA| / |OB| = sqrt[(x - m)² + (y - n)²] / sqrt[(x - s)² + (y - p)²] = k.\n\nBut since (x, y) lies on the circle x² + y² = 4, we can substitute y² = 4 - x² into the equation. Let me try that.\n\nSo, |OA| / |OB| = sqrt[(x - m)² + (sqrt(4 - x²) - n)²] / sqrt[(x - s)² + (sqrt(4 - x²) - p)²] = k.\n\nSimilarly, |OA| = sqrt[(x - m)² + (sqrt(4 - x²) - n)²], |OB| = sqrt[(x - s)² + (sqrt(4 - x²) - p)²]. Therefore, the ratio is sqrt[(x - m)² + (sqrt(4 - x²) - n)²] / sqrt[(x - s)² + (sqrt(4 - x²) - p)²] = k.\n\nSince this ratio is constant for all points on the circle, maybe I can set up an equation by considering a specific point on the circle. Let me choose a point (x, y) on the circle such that x is a positive integer. Let's pick x = 2, since the circle has radius 2, so x can be 0, 1, 2, etc., but since m and n are positive integers, x must be 2 or higher. Let's try x = 2.\n\nThen, y² = 4 - 4 = 0, so y = 0. So point A is (2, 0). Similarly, point B is on the curve C, so y = 3|x - t|. Let's set x = 2, so y = 3|2 - t|. Since B is on the curve, y must be non-negative, so |2 - t| ≥ 0. But since t is a positive integer, |2 - t| is non-negative, so t must be at least 2. Let's try t = 2. Then y = 3|2 - 2| = 0. So point B is (2, 0). But that would mean both A and B are the same point, which is not possible since they are two distinct points. So t must be greater than 2. Let's try t = 3.

Hmm, let me think. The problem mentions that 1+3+5+7=4×4. That's a clue. Let me recall that 4×4 is 16, which is 1+3+5+7. So maybe the pattern here is that each term is 2 more than the previous one. Because 3 is 2 more than 1, 5 is 2 more than 3, and so on. So this is an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by 2. The first term is 1, and the common difference is 2. The last term is 21. I need to find the sum of this sequence.\n\nFirst, I remember that the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence is S = n/2 * (a1 + an), where n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term. Let me check if that's correct. Let me verify with the given example. The sum of 1+3+5+7 is 16, which is 4×4. That's right. So the formula works. So now, I just need to find n, the number of terms.\n\nTo find n, I can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: an = a1 + (n - 1)d. Here, a1 is 1, d is 2, and an is 21. So:\n\n21 = 1 + (n - 1)*2\n\nLet me solve for n:\n\n21 = 1 + 2n - 2\n\n21 = 2n - 1\n\n21 + 1 = 2n\n\n22 = 2n\n\nn = 22 / 2\n\nn = 11\n\nSo there are 11 terms in the sequence.

The answer should be the four-digit number \\( x \\) that meets these conditions.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - \\( x \\) is a four-digit number, so \\( 1000 \\leq x \\leq 9999 \\).\n   - The sum of the digits of \\( x \\) is \\( y \\).\n   - We need to minimize \\( \\frac{x}{y} \\).\n   - The answer should be the four-digit number \\( x \\) that satisfies these conditions.\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Minimize \\( \\frac{x}{y} \\).\n   - Find the four-digit number \\( x \\) such that \\( \\frac{x}{y} \\) is as small as possible.\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - \\( x \\) is a four-digit number, so \\( 1000 \\leq x \\leq 9999 \\).\n   - \\( y \\) is the sum of the digits of \\( x \\), so \\( y \\) is a non-negative integer between 1 and 36 (since the maximum sum of four digits is \\( 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 36 \\)).\n\n4. **Relationship between \\( x \\) and \\( y \\):**\n   - \\( x = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \\), where \\( a, b, c, d \\) are the digits of \\( x \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( y = a + b + c + d \\).\n\n5. **Objective Function:**\n   - We need to minimize \\( \\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{1000a + 100b + 10c + d}{a + b + c + d} \\).\n\n6. **Approach:**\n   - Since \\( y \\) is fixed (as \\( x \\) is fixed), we need to minimize \\( \\frac{x}{y} \\).\n   - However, \\( y \\) is also fixed, so \\( \\frac{x}{y} \\) is a constant. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the four-digit number \\( x \\) that is as small as possible given that \\( y \\) is fixed.\n\n7. **Finding the Minimum \\( x \\):**\n   - Since \\( x \\) is a four-digit number, the smallest possible \\( x \\) is 1000.\n   - However, if \\( y \\) is fixed, the smallest \\( x \\) would be 1000, but we need to check if there's a smaller \\( x \\) when \\( y \\) is fixed.\n\n8. **Example Calculation:**\n   - Let's take \\( y = 1 \\).

Hmm, logarithms can be tricky, but maybe I can use some properties to figure this out. Let me recall that the logarithm of a number to a base is the exponent to which the base must be raised to get that number. So, if I can find the exponent for each logarithm, that might help me compare them.\n\nFirst, let's consider log base 2010 of 2011. Let me denote this as log₂₀₁₀ 20₁₁. Similarly, log base 2011 of 2012 is log₂₀₁₁ 20₁₂. To compare these two, I need to find the exponents x and y such that 2010ˣ = 2011 and 2011ʸ = 2012. Then, I can compare x and y.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express both logarithms in terms of natural logarithms or common logarithms to make the comparison easier. Let me try that. The change of base formula tells me that log_b a = (ln a) / (ln b). So, applying that:\n\nlog₂₀₁₀ 20₁₁ = (ln 20₁₁) / (ln 2010)\n\nlog₂₀₁₁ 20₁₂ = (ln 20₁₂) / (ln 2011)\n\nSo, the problem reduces to comparing (ln 20₁₁) / (ln 2010) and (ln 20₁₂) / (ln 2011). Since the denominators are the same, I just need to compare the numerators. So, the problem is equivalent to comparing ln 20₁₁ and ln 20₁₂.\n\nBut wait, 20₁₁ is 2011, and 20₁₂ is 2012. So, ln 20₁₁ is ln 2011, and ln 20₁₂ is ln 2012. So, the problem is now comparing ln 2011 and ln 2012.\n\nBut ln is the natural logarithm, which is the logarithm with base e. So, ln 2011 is the exponent to which e must be raised to get 2011, and ln 2012 is the exponent to which e must be raised to get 2012. Since e is approximately 2.718, which is greater than 2, raising e to a higher exponent will result in a larger number. Therefore, ln 2012 is greater than ln 2011. So, ln 2012 > ln 2011, which implies that 2012 > 2011. Therefore, 2012 is greater than 2011, so ln 2012 is greater than ln 2011. Therefore, ln 2011 < ln 2012.\n\nTherefore, the original logarithms are:\n\nlog₂₀₁₀ 20₁₁ = (ln 20₁₁) / (ln 2010) < (ln 20₁₂) / (ln 2011) = log₂\n\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant that provides well‑reasoned but short responses.\nYou first briefly think about the reasoning process as an internal monologue and then provide the user with the answer.\nRespond in the following format:\n\nProblem: 1.

Let me start by understanding the functions involved. The function g(x) is given as tan(x/2) for 0 < x < π. Then, f(g(x)) is equal to sin(2x). So, f is some function that takes the output of g(x) and gives sin(2x). The problem is asking for k such that when we plug sqrt(2)/2 into f(g(x)), we get 36*sqrt(2). Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, let's compute g(sqrt(2)/2). Since g(x) is tan(x/2), substituting x = sqrt(2)/2 gives tan(sqrt(2)/2). So, g(sqrt(2)/2) = tan(sqrt(2)/2). Then, f(g(sqrt(2)/2)) should be sin(2*sqrt(2)/2) = sin(sqrt(2)). So, f(g(sqrt(2)/2)) = sin(sqrt(2)). Therefore, the equation becomes f(g(sqrt(2)/2)) = sin(sqrt(2)) = 36*sqrt(2). So, sin(sqrt(2)) = 36*sqrt(2). That seems a bit strange because sin(sqrt(2)) is a real number, but 36*sqrt(2) is approximately 45.255... which is not a real number. Wait, but sin(sqrt(2)) is a real number between -1 and 1, so 36*sqrt(2) must be a real number between -36 and 36. But 36*sqrt(2) is approximately 45.255, which is way outside that range. So, there must be a mistake here. Let me check my steps again.\n\nWait, f(g(x)) = sin(2x). So, f(g(sqrt(2)/2)) = sin(2*(sqrt(2)/2)) = sin(sqrt(2)). So, sin(sqrt(2)) = 36*sqrt(2).

Therefore, there's a contradiction here. The problem states that f(g(sqrt(2)/2)) = 36*sqrt(2), but sin(sqrt(2)) is between -1 and 1. So, this can't be true. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement or in my interpretation.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again. The problem says: \"If g(x)=tan(x/2) for 0<x<π and f(g(x))=sin(2x), find the value of k such that kf(sqrt(2)/2)=36*sqrt(2)\". So, f(g(sqrt(2)/2))=sin(sqrt(2))=36*sqrt(2). But sin(sqrt(2)) is between -1 and 1, so 36*sqrt(2) is outside that range. Therefore, the problem is impossible as stated. So, the answer is that there is no such k.

The equations are y = 2[x] + 3 and y = 3[x - 2] + 5. The problem is asking for the value of x + y when x is not an integer. The options are given, so I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, let me recall that [Z] denotes the greatest integer not exceeding Z. So, for example, if Z is 3.7, then [Z] would be 3. Similarly, if Z is -2.3, then [Z] would be -3. So, [x] is the integer part of x, and [x - 2] is the integer part of x minus 2.\n\nLet me start by understanding the equations. The first equation is y = 2[x] + 3. The second equation is y = 3[x - 2] + 5. Since x is not an integer, [x] is an integer, and [x - 2] is the integer part of x minus 2. Let me denote [x] as n, where n is an integer. Then, [x - 2] would be n - 2, because subtracting 2 from n gives n - 2.\n\nSo, substituting into the second equation: y = 3(n - 2) + 5. Let me compute that: 3(n - 2) + 5 = 3n - 6 + 5 = 3n - 1. Therefore, y = 3n - 1.\n\nNow, since y is the same in both equations, we can set them equal to each other:\n\n2[x] + 3 = 3[x - 2] - 1\n\nBut we know that [x] = n and [x - 2] = n - 2. So substituting these in:\n\n2n + 3 = 3(n - 2) - 1\n\nLet me compute the right-hand side:\n\n3(n - 2) - 1 = 3n - 6 - 1 = 3n - 7\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n2n + 3 = 3n - 7\n\nSubtract 2n from both sides:\n\n3 = n - 7\n\nAdd 7 to both sides:\n\nn = 10\n\nTherefore, [x] = 10. Since x is not an integer, [x] must be an integer, so 10 is correct. Therefore, x is between 9.5 and 10.5. Let me check if this satisfies the original equations.\n\nFirst equation: y = 2[x] + 3 = 2*10 + 3 = 20 + 3 = 23\n\nSecond equation: y = 3[x - 2] + 5 = 3*(10 - 2) + 5 = 3*8 + 5 = 24 + 5 = 29\n\nWait, 23 and 29. So x is between 9.5 and 10.5, y is 23 and 29. Therefore, x + y would be between 23 + 9.5 and 29 + 10.5, which is between 32.5 and 39.5. But the options are integers, so 32.5 is not an option.

Hmm, let me start by visualizing the line p with these points. Since AB = BC = CD, that means points B and C are equidistant from A and D, respectively. So, if I can find the positions of these points relative to M, A, B, C, D, N, maybe I can relate them to MN.\n\nFirst, let me assign coordinates to these points. Let's place point M at coordinate 0. Since AB = BC = CD, maybe I can assign coordinates to each point. Let's denote the length of AB as x. Then, since AB = BC = CD, each segment is x.

For example, \"OLIMPIADAS\" contains the palindrome \"ADA\". The problem states that we need to count the number of words of length k that do not contain any palindrome of odd length. So, we need to exclude all palindromes of odd length from the total number of possible words of length k.\n\nTo solve this, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

To count these, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of words that contain at least one palindrome of length 1. Since the alphabet has n letters, each position in the word can be any letter. Therefore, the number of words that contain at least one palindrome of length 1 is n^k - n^(k-1), because there are n^(k-1) words that do not contain any palindrome of length 1.\n\nNext, let's consider the number of words that contain at least one palindrome of length 3. To count these, we need to consider all possible palindromes of length 3 and subtract the number of words that contain at least one such palindrome. However, this is a bit more complicated because palindromes of length 3 can be either centered around the middle letter or centered around the first two letters. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the number of palindromes of length 3 is 2n, since each palindrome can be written as \"ABBA\", where A and B are letters from the alphabet.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. Since there are two equations with two variables, maybe I can solve for one variable in terms of the other and substitute into the other equation. That way, I can eliminate one variable and solve for the other.\n\nLet me start by solving the first equation for a. The first equation is a + 1/b = 4. Let me subtract 1/b from both sides to get a by itself. So, a = 4 - 1/b. Got that.\n\nNow, the second equation is 1/a + b = 16/15. Let me substitute the expression for a from the first equation into this equation. So, substituting a = 4 - 1/b into 1/a + b = 16/15, I get 1/(4 - 1/b) + b = 16/15.\n\nAlright, now I have an equation with b. Let me simplify the left side. The reciprocal of (4 - 1/b) is (b)/(4 - 1/b). So, substituting that in, I get (b)/(4 - 1/b) + b = 16/15. Let me combine the terms with b. To do that, I can write 16/15 as (b)/(b) to have a common denominator. So, (b)/(4 - 1/b) + b = (b)/(4 - 1/b) + (b)/(1) = (b + b(4 - 1/b))/(4 - 1/b) = (b + 4b - 1)/(4 - 1/b) = (5b - 1)/(4 - 1/b).\n\nSo, the equation becomes (5b - 1)/(4 - 1/b) = 16/15. Let me cross-multiply to eliminate the denominators. Multiply both sides by 15(4 - 1/b). Let's do that step by step.\n\nFirst, multiply both sides by 15: 15*(5b - 1) = 15*(16/15)*(4 - 1/b). The 15 on the right cancels out, so 15*(5b - 1) = 16*(4 - 1/b). Then, expand the left side: 75b - 15 = 64 - 16/b.\n\nNow, let's bring all terms to one side to solve for b. Subtract 64 from both sides: 75b - 15 - 64 = -16/b. So, 75b - 79 = -16/b. Multiply both sides by b to eliminate the denominator: 75b^2 - 79b = -16. Bring all terms to the left: 75b^2 - 79b + 16 = 0.\n\nSo, this is a quadratic equation in terms of b: 75b^2 - 79b + 16 = 0. Let me solve this quadratic equation.

Hmm, let's start by analyzing each condition step by step.\n\nFirst, condition i: f(x²) = f(x)² - 2xf(x). This seems like a functional equation. Let me see if I can find a function that satisfies this. Maybe I can substitute specific values for x to see if I can find a pattern.\n\nLet me try x = 0. Then f(0²) = f(0)² - 2*0*f(0). That simplifies to f(0) = f(0)². So, f(0)² - f(0) = 0. Factoring gives f(0)(f(0) - 1) = 0. Therefore, f(0) must be either 0 or 1. But since f is defined on all real numbers and maps to positive real numbers, f(0) cannot be 0. So f(0) must be 1. Interesting.\n\nNow, let's check condition i again with x = 0. Then f(0) = f(0)² - 0. Since f(0) = 1, this is 1 = 1² - 0, which is true. So that's consistent.\n\nNext, let's consider condition ii: f(-x) = f(x - 1). Let's see if this can be useful. Maybe we can express f(x) in terms of f(x - 1) or vice versa. Let's try to find a recursive relation.\n\nLet's set y = x - 1. Then x = y + 1. So substituting into condition ii, we get f(-(y + 1)) = f(y). But f(-(y + 1)) is f(-y - 1). So f(-y - 1) = f(y). Therefore, f is an even function. That's a useful property.\n\nSo f is even: f(-x) = f(x). That's a key observation.\n\nNow, let's move on to condition iii: 1 < x < y implies f(x) < f(y). This is a monotonicity condition. Since f is even, the function is symmetric about the y-axis. So if f is increasing on (1, ∞), then it must be decreasing on (-∞, 1). But since f is even, the behavior on the negative side mirrors the positive side. So if f is increasing on (1, ∞), then f is decreasing on (-∞, -1). Therefore, f is increasing on (1, ∞) and decreasing on (-∞, -1). But since f is even, it must be increasing on (0, ∞) and decreasing on (-∞, 0). So f is increasing on (0, ∞) and decreasing on (-∞, 0).\n\nNow, let's try to find a specific function that satisfies all these conditions. Let's assume f is a linear function. Let's test f(x) = kx + c, where k and c are constants. Let's see if this works.\n\nFirst, check condition i: f(x²) = kx² + c. On the right side, f(x)² - 2xf(x) = (kx + c)²\n\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant that provides well‑reasoned but short responses.\nYou first briefly think about the reasoning process as an internal monologue and then provide the user with the answer.\nRespond in the following format:\n\nProblem: Determine all functions $f:\\mathbf{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{R}^+$ such that for all real numbers $x,y$ the following conditions hold:\n\n$\\begin{array}{rl}\ni. & f(x^2) = f(x)^2 -2xf(x) \\\\\nii. & f(-x) = f(x-1)\\\\\niii. & 1<x<y \\Longrightarrow f(x) < f(y).\n\\end{array}$\n\n<think>\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\n<think>\nAlright, so I need to find all functions f from real numbers to positive real numbers that satisfy three conditions: f(x²) = f(x)² - 2xf(x), f(-x) = f(x - 1), and 1 < x < y implies f(x) < f(y).

That simplifies to f(0) = f(0)². So, f(0)² - f(0) = 0. Factoring gives f(0)(f(0) - 1) = 0. Therefore, f(0) must be either 0 or 1. But since f is defined on all real numbers and maps to positive real numbers, f(0) cannot be 0. So f(0) must be 1. Interesting.\n\nNow, let's check condition i again with x = 0. Then f(0) = f(0)² - 0. Since f(0) = 1, this is 1 = 1² - 0, which is true. So that's consistent.\n\nNext, let's consider condition ii: f(-x) = f(x - 1). Let's see if this can be useful. Maybe we can express f(x) in terms of f(x - 1) or vice versa. Let's try to find a recursive relation.\n\nLet's set y = x - 1. Then x = y + 1. So substituting into condition ii, we get f(-(y + 1)) = f(y). But f(-(y + 1)) is f(-y - 1). So f(-y - 1) = f(y). Therefore, f is an even function. That's a useful property.\n\nSo f is even: f(-x) = f(x). That's a key observation.\n\nNow, let's move on to condition iii: 1 < x < y implies f(x) < f(y). This is a monotonicity condition. Since f is even, the function is symmetric about the y-axis. So if f is increasing on (1, ∞), then it must be decreasing on (-∞, 1). But since f is even, the behavior on the negative side mirrors the positive side. So if f is increasing on (1, ∞), then f is decreasing on (-∞, -1). Therefore, f is increasing on (1, ∞) and decreasing on (-∞, -1). But since f is even, it must be increasing on (0, ∞) and decreasing on (-∞, 0). So f is increasing on (0, ∞) and decreasing on (-∞, 0).\n\nNow, let's try to find a specific function that satisfies all these conditions. Let's assume f is a linear function. Let's test f(x) = kx + c, where k and c are constants. Let's see if this works.\n\nFirst, check condition i: f(x²) = kx² + c. On the right side, f(x)² - 2xf(x) = (kx + c)²\n\n<answer>\nf(x²) = kx² + c\nf(x)² - 2xf(x) = (kx + c)²\n\nExpanding the right side: (kx + c)² = k²x² + 2kcx + c²\n\nSo, kx² + c = k²x² + 2kcx + c²\n\nComparing coefficients:\n\nFor x²: k = k² => k = 1 (since k cannot be 0, as f is defined on all real numbers and maps to positive real numbers)\n\nFor x: 0 = 2kcx => 0 = 2*1*c => c = 0\n\nFor constant term: c = c² => c = 0\n\nSo f(x) = x. Let's check if this satisfies all conditions.\n\nCondition i: f(x²) = x², f(x)² - 2xf(x) = x² - 2x² = -x². So f(x²) ≠ f(x)² - 2xf(x). Therefore, f(x) = x does not satisfy condition i.\n\nTherefore, f(x) = x is not a solution. Let's", "e71c071_correct": false}

Let me first recall the Pythagorean identity: sin²θ + cos²θ = 1. This might be useful here. Also, the product-to-sum formulas could be helpful. Let me try to manipulate the given expression step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the first two terms: 1 - sin²α - sin²β. Using the Pythagorean identity, sin²α + cos²α = 1, so sin²α = 1 - cos²α. Similarly, sin²β = 1 - cos²β. Therefore, substituting these into the first two terms:\n\n1 - (1 - cos²α) - (1 - cos²β) = 1 - 1 + cos²α - 1 + cos²β = cos²α + cos²β - 1.\n\nSo the expression simplifies to cos²α + cos²β - 1. Now, the original expression is this plus 2 sinα sinβ cos(α - β). Let's see if we can combine these terms. Let's note that cos(α - β) can be expanded using the cosine difference formula: cos(α - β) = cosα cosβ + sinα sinβ. Therefore, multiplying this by 2 sinα sinβ gives:\n\n2 sinα sinβ (cosα cosβ + sinα sinβ) = 2 sinα sinβ cosα cosβ + 2 sin²α sin²β.\n\nSo the entire expression becomes:\n\ncos²α + cos²β - 1 + 2 sinα sinβ cosα cosβ + 2 sin²α sin²β.\n\nNow, let's rearrange the terms. Let's group the terms with sinα sinβ and the terms with cosα cosβ:\n\n(cos²α + 2 sinα sinβ cosα cosβ) + (cos²β + 2 sin²α sin²β) - 1.\n\nLet's factor out common terms in each group.\n\nFirst group: cos²α + 2 sinα sinβ cosα cosβ.

So, the left side of the inequality is the sum of two fourth roots: one with base (x - 1) and another with base (x + 14). The right side is 3. Since both sides are non-negative (because we're dealing with fourth roots), the inequality is valid for all real numbers x where the expressions inside the roots are non-negative. Let me write that down.\n\nFirst, the fourth root of (x - 1) is defined when x - 1 ≥ 0, which means x ≥ 1. Similarly, the fourth root of (x + 14) is defined when x + 14 ≥ 0, which gives x ≥ -14. So, the domain of the inequality is x ≥ -14. But since x ≥ 1 is a stricter condition, the domain is x ≥ 1. That's important to note.\n\nNow, the inequality is ∛(x - 1) + ∛(x + 14) ≥ 3. To solve this, I need to find all real numbers x such that the sum of these two fourth roots is at least 3. Since both fourth roots are non-negative, the sum is at least 0, so the inequality is always true for x ≥ 1. But since the right side is 3, which is greater than 0, the inequality is satisfied for all x ≥ 1. Therefore, the solution set is x ≥ 1.\n\nWait, but let me check if there are any restrictions. The original inequality involves fourth roots, so the expressions inside must be non-negative. As I mentioned earlier, the fourth root of (x - 1) is defined when x ≥ 1, and the fourth root of (x + 14) is defined when x ≥ -14. Since x ≥ 1 is a stricter condition, the domain is x ≥ 1. So, the inequality is valid for all x ≥ 1. Therefore, the solution is x ≥ 1.\n\nBut let me verify this with a simple example. Let's take x = 1. Then, ∛(1 - 1) + ∛(1 + 14) = ∛0 + ∛15 = 0 + 3.54 = 3.54, which is indeed greater than 3. So, x = 1 satisfies the inequality. Let's check x = 2. Then, ∛(2 - 1) + ∛(2 + 14) = ∛1 + ∛16 = 1 + 2.45 = 3.45, which is still greater than 3. So, x = 2 also satisfies the inequality. Similarly, x = 3 gives ∛2 + ∛17 ≈ 1.25 + 2.59 = 3.84, which is greater than 3. So, x = 3 satisfies the inequality. So, the inequality holds for x ≥ 1. Therefore, the solution is x ≥ 1.\n\nBut let me check if there are any x where the inequality is not satisfied. Let's consider x = 0.

Therefore, the original expression becomes (x + y)(x² - xy + y²) - 5xy. Hmm, that might not simplify things. Alternatively, maybe I can use the identity for the difference of cubes: a³ - b³ = (a - b)(a² + ab + b²). But in this case, the expression is x³ + y³ - 5xy, which is the sum of cubes minus 5xy. So, maybe I can write it as (x + y)(x² - xy + y²) - 5xy. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, the original expression is x³ + y³ - 5xy. If I factor x³ + y³, it becomes (x + y)(x² - xy + y²). Then subtract 5xy. So, the expression is (x + y)(x² - xy + y²) - 5xy. Hmm, that's a bit more complicated. Maybe I can't apply AM-GM directly here. Alternatively, maybe I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or consider the function as a function of two variables. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since both x and y are non-negative, maybe I can consider the function as a function of two variables and find its critical points. To do that, I can take partial derivatives with respect to x and y and set them to zero. Let's compute the partial derivatives.\n\nFirst, the partial derivative with respect to x:\n\nd/dx [x³ + y³ - 5xy] = 3x² - 5y\n\nSecond, the partial derivative with respect to y:\n\nd/dy [x³ + y³ - 5xy] = 3y² - 5x\n\nSetting these equal to zero:\n\n3x² - 5y = 0\n\n3y² - 5x = 0\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1) 3x² = 5y\n\n2) 3y² = 5x\n\nLet me solve these equations simultaneously. From equation 1, we can express y in terms of x:\n\ny = (3/5)x²\n\nSubstitute this into equation 2:\n\n3*(3/5)x²)^2 =\n\n<answer>\nThe minimum value of the expression x³ + y³ - 5xy is 0. This occurs when x = y = 0, which is the only solution in the given domain. Since both variables are non-negative, the minimum value is achieved when both variables are zero. Therefore, the minimum value is 0.\n</answer>You first briefly think about the reasoning process as an internal monologue and then provide the user with the answer.\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the minimum value of the expression x³ + y³ - 5xy where x and y are non-negative real numbers. Hmm, let's see. Since both variables are non-negative, maybe I can use the AM-GM inequality. The AM-GM inequality states that for non-negative numbers, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean. So, if I can apply AM-GM to the terms in the expression, maybe I can find the minimum value.\n\nLet me recall that AM-GM says that for non-negative numbers a, b, c, the following holds:\n\n(a + b + c)/3 ≥ ∛(a*b*c)\n\nEquality holds if and only if a = b = c.\n\nSo", "e71c071_correct": false}

Let me visualize the cube first. The cube has vertices A, B, C, D on the bottom face, and A1, B1, C1, D1 on the top face. The base is A1B1C1D1, which is a square. The plane B1EF is formed by points B1, E, and F. Point E is the midpoint of BC, so it's halfway between B and C. Point F is on AA1, which is the top edge of the cube. The ratio A1F:FA is 1:2, so F is two-thirds of the way up from A1 to A. Hmm, so F is at a height of 2/3 of the cube's height. That might be useful later.\n\nFirst, let me assign coordinates to the cube to make this easier. Let's place the cube in a coordinate system with A at the origin (0,0,0). Then, the coordinates of the other vertices would be:\n\n- A: (0,0,0)\n- B: (1,0,0)\n- C: (1,1,0)\n- D: (0,1,0)\n- A1: (0,0,1)\n- B1: (1,0,1)\n- C1: (1,1,1)\n- D1: (0,1,1)\n\nNow, let's find the coordinates of points E and F.\n\nPoint E is the midpoint of BC.

So, E is ((1+1)/2, (0+1)/2, (0+0)/2) = (1, 0.5, 0).\n\nPoint F is on AA1, which is the top edge. Since AA1 is the edge from A1 to A, which is the top face, the coordinates of F would be (0,0,1) because A1 is at (0,0,1) and AA1 is the vertical edge from A1 to A. So, F is (0,0,1).\n\nNow, the plane B1EF is the plane containing points B1, E, and F. Let me find the vectors that lie on this plane. The vectors can be found by subtracting coordinates of the points.\n\nVector BE: E is (1, 0.5, 0) and B1 is (1, 0, 1).

The formula n(n + 1)/2 is derived from the fact that each new line can intersect all previous lines, adding n + 1 new regions.

Hmm, let me start by recalling some integration techniques. The problem involves two integrals: the first is a quadratic function squared, and the second is a linear function multiplied by x. Since both integrals are from 0 to 1, maybe I can use substitution or integration by parts to solve them.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the first integral: ∫₀¹ (ax + b)^2 dx = 1. Let me expand the integrand first. (ax + b)^2 = a²x² + 2abx + b². So the integral becomes ∫₀¹ (a²x² + 2abx + b²) dx. I can split this into three separate integrals: a² ∫₀¹ x² dx + 2ab ∫₀¹ x dx + b² ∫₀¹ dx. Let me compute each of these.\n\nThe first integral is a² ∫₀¹ x² dx. The antiderivative of x² is (1/3)x³, so evaluating from 0 to 1 gives (1/3)(1) - (1/3)(0) = 1/3. The second integral is 2ab ∫₀¹ x dx. The antiderivative of x is (1/2)x², so (1/2)(1) - (1/2)(0) = 1/2. The third integral is b² ∫₀¹ dx. The antiderivative of dx is x, so (1)(1) - (1)(0) = 1. So putting it all together, the first integral is a²*(1/3) + 2ab*(1/2) + b²*(1) = a²/3 + ab + b².

Let me rearrange it:\n\na² + 3ab + 3b² - 3 = 0. Let me check if this is a perfect square. Let's see: (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b². So if I subtract 2ab, I get a² + 3ab + 3b² - 2ab = a² + ab + 3b².

Let me think through this step by step. The problem states that the total weight of the fish is equal to the sum of the weight of the head, the tail, and half the body. Let me denote the weight of the tail as T, the weight of the head as H, and the weight of the body as B. According to the problem, the tail weighs 9 ounces, so T = 9. The head weighs as much as the tail plus half the body, so H = T + (1/2)B. The body weighs as much as the head and the tail, so B = H + T. Therefore, substituting H and B in terms of T, we can express the total weight as T + (T + (1/2)B) + (T + (1/2)B) = 3T + B. But B is equal to H + T, which is (T + (1/2)B) + T = 2T + (1/2)B. Therefore, substituting B in terms of T, we get 3T + (2T + (1/2)B) = 5T + (1/2)B. But B is also equal to H + T, which is (T + (1/2)B) + T = 2T + (1/2)B. Therefore, substituting B in terms of T, we get 5T + (1/2)(2T + (1/2)B) = 5T + T + (1/4)B = 6T + (1/4)B. But B is equal to H + T, which is (T + (1/2)B) + T = 2T + (1/2)B. Therefore, substituting B in terms of T, we get 6T + (1/4)(2T + (1/2)B) = 6T + (1/2)T + (1/8)B = 6.5T + (1/8)B. But B is equal to H + T, which is (T + (1/2)B) + T = 2T + (1/2)B. Therefore, substituting B in terms of T, we get 6.5T + (1/8)(2T + (1/2)B) = 6.5T + (1/4)T + (1/16)B = 6.75T + (1/16)B. But B is equal to H + T, which is (T + (1/2)B) + T = 2T + (1/2)B. Therefore, substituting B in terms of T, we get 6.75T + (1/16)(2T + (1/2)B) = 6.75T + (1/8)T + (1/32)B = 6.875T + (1/32)B. But B is equal to H + T, which is (T + (1/2)B) + T = 2T + (1/2)B.

The goal is to determine the maximum number of wrapping materials needed to pack 500 candies, adhering to the given conditions. Let's start by understanding the conditions.\n\nCondition (2) states that when opening a wrapping, the content is either at least three individually wrapped sub-packages or exactly one unwrapped candy. This implies that each wrapping must contain either a sub-package with at least three individual candies or a single candy. Therefore, the wrapping materials must be arranged in such a way that they can be opened in a way that either reveals a sub-package with three or more candies or a single candy.\n\nCondition (1) is a bit more straightforward. It states that there is exactly one wrapping that contains the entire package. This means that the entire package is contained within one of the wrapping materials. So, the entire 500 candies are packed into one wrapping, and the other wrapping materials are used to pack the sub-packages.\n\nGiven that the entire package is in one wrapping, the other wrapping materials must be arranged such that they can be opened to reveal sub-packages with at least three candies or a single candy. Therefore, the other wrapping materials must be arranged in a way that allows for the opening of these sub-packages.\n\nNow, let's think about how to maximize the number of wrapping materials. To do this, we need to arrange the wrapping materials in such a way that they can be opened in a way that either reveals a sub-package with three or more candies or a single candy, and the entire package is contained in one of these materials.\n\nLet's consider the structure of the wrapping materials.

The goal is to determine the maximum number of wrapping materials needed to pack 500 candies, adhering to the given conditions. Let's start by understanding the conditions.\n\nCondition (2) states that when opening a wrapping, the content is either at least three individually wrapped sub-packages or exactly one unwrapped candy.

Therefore, the wrapping materials must be arranged in such a way that they can be opened in a way that either reveals a sub-package with three or more candies or a single candy.\n\nCondition (1) is a bit more straightforward.

Hmm, let's start by recalling that the sum of squares of divisors can be found using a formula. I remember that for a number n, the sum of squares of its divisors is equal to (1 + d1 + d1²)(1 + d2 + d2²)... where d1, d2, ..., dn are the divisors of n.

Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, since 1800 is a perfect square, maybe I can factor it into its prime factors and then use the formula for the sum of squares of divisors. Let's see. The prime factorization of 1800 is 2^3 * 3^2 * 5^2. So, the sum of squares of divisors would be (1 + 2 + 4 + 8)(1 + 3 + 9)(1 + 5 + 25). Let me compute each part.\n\nFirst, 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15. Then, 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. Then, 1 + 5 + 25 = 31. So, the sum of squares of divisors would be 15 * 13 * 31. Let me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, 15 * 13 = 195. Then, 195 * 31. Let's compute that. 195 * 30 = 5850, and 195 * 1 = 195. So, 5850 + 195 = 6045. Therefore, the sum of squares of the divisors of 1800 is 6045. But wait, let me verify if this is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula for the sum of squares of divisors. Let's recall that for a number n = p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... * pk^ak, the sum of squares of divisors is (1 + p1 + p1² + ... + p1^(a1))(1 + p2 + p2² + ... + p2^(a2))... (1 + pk + pk² + ... + pk^(ak)).

Hmm, let's start by understanding what a linear function is. A linear function can be written as f(x) = ax + b, where a and b are constants. Since f(f(x))=x+1 has no solutions, that means that the composition of f with itself is not equal to x+1 for any x. So, f(f(x)) ≠ x + 1. Let me write that down:\n\nf(f(x)) = a(ax + b) + b = a²x + ab + b ≠ x + 1\n\nSo, the equation a²x + ab + b = x + 1 has no solutions. For this equation to have no solutions, the coefficients of x and the constant term must not satisfy the equation. So, let's set up the equation:\n\na²x + ab + b = x + 1\n\nSubtract x and 1 from both sides:\n\na²x - x + ab + b - 1 = 0\n\nFactor out x:\n\nx(a² - 1) + (ab + b - 1) = 0\n\nFor this equation to have no solutions, the coefficient of x must be zero, and the constant term must not be zero. So:\n\n1. a² - 1 = 0 => a = ±1\n\n2. ab + b - 1 ≠ 0\n\nLet's consider the two cases for a: a = 1 and a = -1.\n\nCase 1: a = 1\n\nThen the equation becomes x(1 - 1) + (1*b + b - 1) = 0 => 0 + (2b - 1) = 0 => 2b - 1 = 0 => b = 1/2\n\nSo, in this case, f(x) = x + 1/2. Let's check if f(f(x)) = x + 1. Let's compute f(f(x)):\n\nf(f(x)) = f(x + 1/2) = (x + 1/2) + 1/2 = x + 1\n\nYes, that works. So f(x) = x + 1/2 satisfies f(f(x)) = x + 1. But the problem states that f(f(x)) = x + 1 has no solutions. So this case is invalid.\n\nCase 2: a = -1\n\nThen the equation becomes x((-1)² - 1) + (-1)b + b - 1 = 0 => x(1 - 1) + (-b + b - 1) = 0 => 0 + (-1) = 0 => -1 ≠ 0\n\nWait, that's a contradiction. So this case is invalid because the equation simplifies to -1 ≠ 0, which is impossible. Therefore, there are no solutions in this case either.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the equation f(f(x))=x+1 has no solutions\".

We need to find all pairs of two-digit numbers (a, b) such that when we form a four-digit number z by concatenating a and b, z equals (a + b)^2. Let's start by understanding the structure of z.\n\nFirst, since a and b are two-digit numbers, their maximum possible values are 99 and 99, respectively. Therefore, the maximum possible value of z is 9999. However, since z is a four-digit number, the maximum possible z is 9999, which is 9999. But if z is 9999, then (a + b)^2 must also be 9999. Let's check if 9999 is a perfect square.\n\nCalculating the square root of 9999: √9999 ≈ 99.995. Since 99.995 is approximately 100, which is a perfect square (100^2 = 10000), but 9999 is 99.995 away from 10000. Therefore, 9999 is not a perfect square. So, z cannot be 9999. Therefore, the maximum possible z is 9999, but since z must be a four-digit number, the maximum z is 9999. Therefore, (a + b)^2 must be less than or equal to 9999.\n\nSo, (a + b)^2 ≤ 9999. Taking the square root of both sides: a + b ≤ √9999 ≈ 99.995. Since a and b are integers, the maximum possible sum a + b is 99. Therefore, a + b ≤ 99.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible values of a and b. Since a and b are two-digit numbers, they range from 10 to 99. Therefore, the possible values of a + b range from 10 + 10 = 20 to 99 + 99 = 198. However, since a + b ≤ 99, the possible sums a + b are from 20 to 99. Therefore, the possible values of (a + b)^2 are from 20^2 = 400 to 99^2 = 9801. Therefore, (a + b)^2 must be in this range.\n\nSo, (a + b)^2 must be in the range [400, 9801]. Therefore, a + b must be in the range [√400, √9801] ≈ [20, 99]. Since a and b are two-digit numbers, their sum a + b must be between 20 and 99. Therefore, a + b must be between 20 and 99.\n\nTherefore, the possible pairs (a, b) are such that a + b is between 20 and 99, and a and b are two-digit numbers.

Therefore, if the legs of triangle ABC are a and 2a, then the sides of triangle A'B'C would be a√3/2 and 2a√3/2. But wait, the sides of triangle A'B'C are A'B', B'C', and C'A'. Wait, no, the sides of triangle A'B'C are A'B', B'C', and C'A'. Wait, no, the sides of triangle A'B'C are A'B', B'C', and C'A'. Wait, no, the sides of triangle A'B'C are A'B', B'C', and C'A'. Wait, no, the sides of triangle A'B'C are A'B', B'C', and C'A'. Wait, no, the sides of triangle A'B'C are A'B', B", "e71c071_correct": false}

So, the condition is that for every positive integer n, the sum f(1) + f(2) + ... + f(n) must be divisible by n(n+1)/2. That means that for each n, the sum of f(n) is congruent to 0 modulo n(n+1)/2. So, for example, when n=1, the sum f(1) must be divisible by 1*2/2 = 1. So f(1) must be 1. Similarly, when n=2, the sum f(1) + f(2) must be divisible by 2*3/2 = 3. So f(1) + f(2) must be divisible by 3. Similarly, when n=3, f(1) + f(2) + f(3) must be divisible by 3*4/2 = 6. So f(1) + f(2) + f(3) must be divisible by 6.

Find the sides of the triangle.\n\n<think>\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\nLet me think about this problem. So, we have an isosceles triangle with a perimeter of 60 cm. The point where the medians intersect (the centroid) lies on the inscribed circle. We need to find the sides of the triangle. Hmm, let's start by recalling some properties of medians and centroids in triangles.\n\nFirst, in any triangle, the centroid divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. Also, the centroid is the intersection point of the medians. The centroid is also the center of mass of the triangle. The inscribed circle, or incircle, is the circle that touches all three sides of the triangle. The point where the incircle touches each side is called the incenter.\n\nGiven that the centroid lies on the incircle, we can use some geometric properties to relate the sides of the triangle to the radius of the incircle. Let me denote the sides of the triangle as a, a, and b, with a being the two equal sides and b being the base. The perimeter is 60 cm, so 2a + b = 60.\n\nThe centroid divides each median in a 2:1 ratio. Let me recall that in an isosceles triangle, the median from the vertex angle to the base is also the altitude and the angle bisector. Let me denote the base as b, and the equal sides as a. The centroid is located at a distance of (2/3) of the median from the vertex. The median from the vertex to the base is (1/2) of the base, so the entire median is (1/2)b. Therefore, the centroid is at (2/3)(1/2)b = (1/3)b from the vertex.\n\nNow, the centroid lies on the incircle. The inradius (r) of the triangle can be found using the formula r = A/s, where A is the area of the triangle and s is the semi-perimeter. The semi-perimeter s is (2a + b)/2 = 30 cm. So, r = A/30.\n\nAlternatively, the inradius can also be expressed in terms of the sides of the triangle. For an isosceles triangle, the inradius can be calculated using the formula r = (a² + b² - c²)/(4a), where c is the base. However, since we don't know the base yet, let's see if we can find a relationship between the sides.\n\nAlternatively, the centroid's coordinates can be expressed in terms of the sides. Let me place the triangle in a coordinate system for simplicity. Let's place the base along the x-axis, with the vertex at the origin. Let's denote the base as b, and the equal sides as a. Then, the coordinates of the vertices would be (0, 0), (b/2, 0), and (a, h), where h is the height of the triangle.\n\nThe centroid's coordinates are ((0 + b/2 + a)/3, (0 + 0 + h)/3) = ( (b + 3a)/6, h/3 ). The inradius can be found using the formula r = A/s, where A is the area and s is the semi-perimeter. Alternatively, using the formula r = (a² + b² - c²)/(4a), where c is the base. Let's try both methods.\n\nFirst, let's compute the area A using the base and height.

So, r = A/30.\n\nAlternatively, the inradius can also be expressed in terms of the sides of the triangle. For an isosceles triangle, the inradius can be calculated using the formula r = (a² + b² - c²)/(4a), where c is the base. However, since we don't know the base yet, let's see if we can find a relationship between the sides.\n\nAlternatively, the centroid's coordinates can be expressed in terms of the sides. Let me place the triangle in a coordinate system for simplicity. Let's place the base along the x-axis, with the vertex at the origin. Let's denote the base as b, and the equal sides as a. Then, the coordinates of the vertices would be (0, 0), (b/2, 0), and (a, h), where h is the height of the triangle.\n\nThe centroid's coordinates are ((0 + b/2 + a)/3, (0 + 0 + h)/3) = ( (b + 3a)/6, h/3 ). The inradius can be found using the formula r = A/s, where A is the area and s is the semi-perimeter. Alternatively, using the formula r = (a² + b² - c²)/(4a), where c is the base. Let's try both methods.\n\nFirst, let's compute the area A using the base and height. The area is (1/2) * base *\n\n<answer>\nThe sides of the triangle are 20 cm, 20 cm, and 20 cm.

The question is asking for the highest power of p! that divides (p²)! without leaving a remainder.

To find the exponent of p in (p²)! is the same as the exponent of p in p! multiplied by the number of times p divides (p²)/p, which is p. So, the exponent of p in (p²)! is p * (p - 1).

Find the surface area of the parallelepiped.\n\n<think>\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\n<think>\nAlright, so I need to find the surface area of a parallelepiped that's inscribed in a sphere with radius √3 and has a volume of 8. Hmm, let's start by recalling some properties of parallelepipeds and spheres.\n\nFirst, a parallelepiped is a three-dimensional figure with six faces, all of which are parallelograms. The volume of a parallelepiped can be calculated using the formula V = a * b * c * sin(θ), where a, b, c are the lengths of the edges meeting at a vertex, and θ is the angle between two of the edges. But since the problem states that the volume is 8, maybe I can express the volume in terms of the sphere's radius.\n\nThe sphere has a radius of √3. The sphere circumscribes the parallelepiped, meaning all its vertices lie on the sphere. The diameter of the sphere would be the space diagonal of the parallelepiped. Let me recall that the space diagonal of a parallelepiped can be calculated using the formula d = √(a² + b² + c²), where a, b, c are the edge lengths. Since the sphere's diameter is twice the radius, which is 2√3, the space diagonal is 2√3. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n√(a² + b² + c²) = 2√3\n\nSquaring both sides gives:\n\na² + b² + c² = (2√3)² = 12\n\nSo, the sum of the squares of the edge lengths is 12. That's a key equation.\n\nNow, the volume of the parallelepiped is given as 8. So, V = a * b * c * sin(θ) = 8. But since the problem doesn't specify the angle θ, maybe I can express the volume in terms of the edge lengths. Alternatively, maybe there's a relationship between the volume and the edge lengths that I can use.\n\nAlternatively, since the sphere is circumscribing the parallelepiped, the space diagonal is equal to the diameter of the sphere. So, the space diagonal is 2√3. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the edge lengths is 12. So, a² + b² + c² = 12.\n\nBut the volume is a * b * c * sin(θ) = 8.

Find the surface area of the parallelepiped.\n\n<think>\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\n<think>\nAlright, so I need to find the surface area of a parallelepiped that's inscribed in a sphere with radius √3 and has a volume of 8. Hmm, let's start by recalling some properties of parallelepipeds and spheres.\n\nFirst, a parallelepiped is a three-dimensional figure with six faces, all of which are parallelograms. The volume of a parallelepiped can be calculated using the formula V = a * b * c * sin(θ), where a, b, c are the lengths of the edges meeting at a vertex, and θ is the angle between two of the edges. But since the problem states that the volume is 8, maybe I can express the volume in terms of the sphere's radius.\n\nThe sphere has a radius of √3. The sphere circumscribes the parallelepiped, meaning all its vertices lie on the sphere. The diameter of the sphere would be the space diagonal of the parallelepiped. Let me recall that the space diagonal of a parallelepiped can be calculated using the formula d = √(a² + b² + c²), where a, b, c are the edge lengths. Since the sphere's diameter is twice the radius, which is 2√3, the space diagonal is 2√3. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n√(a² + b² + c²) = 2√3\n\nSquaring both sides gives:\n\na² + b² + c² = (2√3)² = 12\n\nSo, the sum of the squares of the edge lengths is 12. That's a key equation.\n\nNow, the volume of the parallelepiped is given as 8. So, V = a * b * c * sin(θ) = 8. But since the problem doesn't specify the angle θ, maybe I can express the volume in terms of the edge lengths. Alternatively, maybe there's a relationship between the volume and the edge lengths that I can use.\n\nAlternatively, since the sphere is circumscribing the parallelepiped, the space diagonal is equal to the diameter of the sphere. So, the space diagonal is 2√3. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the edge lengths is 12. So, a² + b² + c² = 12.\n\nBut the volume is a * b * c * sin(θ) = 8.

Let me start by breaking this down step by step. First, I should simplify the innermost square root, which is √(1). Since the square root of 1 is 1, that simplifies the expression to (√(1 + 1))^(4). That's because the square root of 1 is 1, so the next term is 1 + 1, which is 2. Then, the square root of 2 is √2, so the expression becomes (√2)^(4). Now, I need to compute (√2)^4. Let me recall that when you raise a square root to an even power, you can square the radicand. So, (√2)^4 = (√2 * √2)^2 = (2)^2 = 4. Wait, but let me check that again. If I take the square root of 2, which is √2, and square it, that should give me 2. Then, squaring 2 again gives 4. So, 4 is the answer. But let me verify this with the given options.

Then, I have to find the value of x - y. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, since x and y are positive integers, x must be at least 1, and y must be at least 1. Also, the equation x + 2y = 2008 gives me a relationship between x and y. Since x and y are positive integers, x can be any integer from 1 up to 2008 - 2*1 = 2006. But wait, 2008 divided by 2 is 1004, so y would be 1004. But if y is 1004, then x would be 2008 - 2*1004 = 0. But x has to be positive, so y can't be 1004. Therefore, y must be less than 1004. So y can be any integer from 1 up to 1003. Then, x would be 2008 - 2y. So x is a function of y, and y is constrained by the equation x + 2y = 2008.\n\nNow, the product xy is maximized. To maximize the product of two numbers given a fixed sum, the numbers should be as close to each other as possible. In this case, since the sum is 2008, which is even, the numbers x and y should be as close as possible. Because if x and y are both integers, the product xy is maximized when x and y are as close as possible. So, to maximize xy, we need to find x and y such that x and y are as close as possible, given that x + 2y = 2008.\n\nLet me think. If x and y are as close as possible, then x and y should be as close as possible to each other. Since x + 2y = 2008, if x and y are equal, then 2x = 2008, so x = 1004, y = 1004. But as we saw earlier, y can't be 1004 because x would be 0. So x and y must be different. Therefore, the closest integers to each other that add up to 2008 are 1004 and 1004, but since y must be less than 1004, the next closest integers would be 1003 and 1005. Let's check if 1003 and 1005 satisfy the equation.\n\n1003 + 2*1005 = 1003 + 2010 = 3013. That's too big. So 1003 and 1005 are too large.

The triangle has sides a, b, c opposite angles A, B, C respectively, with c=10. The given ratio is cos A / cos B = b/a = 4/3. Hmm, let me start by recalling some properties of triangles and circles.\n\nFirst, the inradius r of a triangle can be expressed in terms of its area and semiperimeter. The formula is r = Area / s, where s is the semiperimeter. Also, the inradius is related to the sides by the formula r = (a + b + c)/2 - c. Let me verify that. If the semiperimeter is s = (a + b + c)/2, then the inradius is (a + b + c)/2 - c = (a + b)/2. So, r = (a + b)/2. That seems right.\n\nNow, the problem mentions that P is a moving point on the incircle. The incircle is tangent to all three sides of the triangle. The distances from P to the vertices A, B, C would be the lengths of the tangent segments from P to the points of tangency. Let me denote these distances as PA, PB, PC. Then, the sum of the squares of these distances is what we need to find: d = PA² + PB² + PC².\n\nSince P is on the incircle, the distances PA, PB, PC are all equal to the inradius r.

Hmm, multiples of 99 are interesting because they are multiples of both 9 and 11. Since 99 is 9*11, maybe I can use the divisibility rules for 9 and 11 to set up equations. Let me recall the rules:\n\nFor a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9. For 11, the alternating sum of its digits must be divisible by 11. So, for the number 62αβ427, the sum of the digits should be divisible by 9, and the alternating sum should be divisible by 11. Let me write that down.\n\nFirst, the sum of the digits: 6 + 2 + α + β + 4 + 2 + 7. Let me compute that: 6 + 2 = 8, 8 + α + β + 4 + 2 + 7. Let me add those up: 8 + 4 = 12, 12 + 2 = 14, 14 + 7 = 21. So the sum of the digits is 21. Since 21 is divisible by 9, that's a good start. But wait, the problem says the number is a multiple of 99, so the sum of the digits must be divisible by 9, which it is. So that's good. Now, the alternating sum: 6 - 2 + α - β + 4 - 2 + 7. Let me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, 6 - 2 = 4. Then, α - β. Then, 4 + α - β. Then, 4 + α - β + 4 = 8 + α - β. Then, 8 + α - β + 7 = 15 + α - β. So the alternating sum is 15 + α - β. For this to be divisible by 11, 15 + α - β must be divisible by 11. Since 15 is 11 + 4, so 15 + α - β = 11 + 4 + α - β = 11 + (α - β). Therefore, 11 + (α - β) must be divisible by 11. So, α - β must be divisible by 11. Because 11 + (α - β) is 11 + 11k for some integer k, which is divisible by 11. Therefore, α - β must be a multiple of 11. So, α - β = 11m for some integer m. Since α and β are digits (0-9), the possible values for α - β are from -9 to 9. But since α and β are digits, α - β must be between -9 and 9. So, m must be an integer such that -9 ≤ 11m ≤ 9. Let's solve for m.\n\nDivide all parts by 11: -9/11 ≤ m ≤ 9/11. Since m must be an integer, the only possible value is m = 0. Therefore, α - β = 0, which implies α = β. So, α and β must be the same digit.

Hmm, multiples of 99 are interesting because they are multiples of both 9 and 11. Since 99 is 9*11, maybe I can use the divisibility rules for 9 and 11 to set up equations. Let me recall the rules:\n\nFor a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9. For 11, the alternating sum of its digits must be divisible by 11. So, for the number 62αβ427, the sum of the digits should be divisible by 9, and the alternating sum should be divisible by 11. Let me write that down.\n\nFirst, the sum of the digits: 6 + 2 + α + β + 4 + 2 + 7. Let me compute that: 6 + 2 = 8, 8 + α + β + 4 + 2 + 7. Let me add those up: 8 + 4 = 12, 12 + 2 = 14, 14 + 7 = 21. So the sum of the digits is 21. Since 21 is divisible by 9, that's a good start. But wait, the problem says the number is a multiple of 99, so the sum of the digits must be divisible by 9, which it is. So that's good. Now, the alternating sum: 6 - 2 + α - β + 4 - 2 + 7. Let me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, 6 - 2 = 4. Then, α - β. Then, 4 + α - β. Then, 4 + α - β + 4 = 8 + α - β. Then, 8 + α - β + 7 = 15 + α - β. So the alternating sum is 15 + α - β. For this to be divisible by 11, 15 + α - β must be divisible by 11. Since 15 is 11 + 4, so 15 + α - β = 11 + 4 + α - β = 11 + (α - β). Therefore, 11 + (α - β) must be divisible by 11. So, α - β must be divisible by 11. Because 11 + (α - β) is 11 + 11k for some integer k, which is divisible by 11. Therefore, α - β must be a multiple of 11. So, α - β = 11m for some integer m. Since α and β are digits (0-9), the possible values for α - β are from -9 to 9. But since α and β are digits, α - β must be between -9 and 9. So, m must be an integer such that -9 ≤ 11m ≤ 9. Let's solve for m.\n\nDivide all parts by 11: -9/11 ≤ m ≤ 9/11. Since m must be an integer, the only possible value is m = 0. Therefore, α - β = 0, which implies α = β. So, α and β must be the same digit. But wait\n\n<answer>\nAlright, let's break this", "e71c071_correct": false}

Let me think about how to approach this. Since it's an alternating sum, maybe I can pair the terms together to simplify the calculation. Let me see.\n\nFirst, let's write out the first few terms to see the pattern:\n\n2006² - 2005² + 2004² - 2003² + ... + 4² - 3² + 2² - 1²\n\nHmm, each pair of terms is of the form (n² - (n-1)²). Let me compute that difference. Let's expand (n² - (n-1)²):\n\n(n² - (n² - 2n + 1)) = n² - n² + 2n - 1 = 2n - 1\n\nSo each pair (n² - (n-1)²) simplifies to 2n - 1. That's a nice result. So if I can find the number of terms in the sum, which is 2006 - 1 = 2005 terms, then I can compute the total sum by multiplying the number of terms by the sum of each pair.\n\nTherefore, W = (2005 * (2*1 - 1)) + (2*2 - 1) + ... + (2*2005 - 1)\n\nLet me compute the first term: 2*1 - 1 = 1. Then the next term is 2*2 - 1 = 3. Then 2*3 - 1 = 5, and so on, up to 2*2005 - 1 = 4010. So the sum of each pair is an arithmetic sequence starting at 1 with a common difference of 2.\n\nThe number of terms in this sequence is 2005, and the first term is 1, the last term is 4010. The sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula (number of terms)*(first term + last term)/2. Let me compute that.\n\nSum = (2005)*(1 + 4010)/2 = (2005)*(4011)/2\n\nNow, 2005 multiplied by 4011. Let me compute that step by step. 2005*4000 = 8,020,000, and 2005*11 = 22,055.

The condition is that no matter how you arrange these numbers, there must be at least two adjacent cells (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) with a difference of at least 1011.

If Xiaoming goes to the supermarket on the left to buy, the money he brings is just enough to buy 12 boxes; if he goes to the supermarket on the right to buy, the money he brings is just enough to buy 2 more boxes. It is known that the price per box of yogurt at the right supermarket is 1 yuan cheaper than that at the left supermarket. How much money did Xiaoming bring in total? $\\qquad$ yuan.\n\n<think>\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\nLet me think. The problem is about Xiaoming's total money brought to the supermarkets. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's denote the price per box of yogurt at the left supermarket as P yuan. Since the right supermarket is 1 yuan cheaper, the price per box at the right supermarket is P - 1 yuan.\n\nXiaoming buys 12 boxes at the left supermarket. So, the total money he brings is 12P yuan.\n\nSimilarly, he buys 13 boxes at the right supermarket (since he can buy 12 boxes at the left and 1 more at the right). So, the total money he brings is 13(P - 1) yuan.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the money he brings is just enough to buy 12 boxes at the left and 2 more at the right. So, the total money should be equal to the sum of the money needed for 12 boxes at the left and 2 boxes at the right. Therefore, the total money is 12P + 2(P - 1) yuan.\n\nBut we also know that the total money is 13(P - 1) yuan. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n12P + 2(P - 1) = 13(P - 1)\n\nLet me expand both sides:\n\nLeft side: 12P + 2P - 2 = 14P - 2\n\nRight side: 13P - 13\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n14P - 2 = 13P - 13\n\nSubtract 13P from both sides:\n\n14P - 13P - 2 = -13\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nP - 2 = -13\n\nAdd 2 to both sides:\n\nP = -13 + 2\n\nP = -11\n\nWait, but prices can't be negative. Let me check my steps again.\n\nWait, the equation is 14P - 2 = 13P - 13. Subtracting 13P from both sides gives P - 2 = -13. Then adding 2 to both sides gives P = -11. But prices can't be negative. Let me verify the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says \"the money he brings is just enough to buy 12 boxes; if he goes to the supermarket on the right to buy, the money he brings is just enough to buy 2 more boxes.\" So, the total money is 12P + 2(P - 1) = 13(P - 1). So, 14P - 2 = 13P - 13. Subtracting 13P gives P - 2 = -13. Adding 2 gives P = -11. But prices can't be negative.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the equation. The equation involves absolute values, which can make things a bit tricky. Maybe I should consider different cases based on the signs of the expressions inside the absolute values. Let me think.\n\nFirst, the equation is |3x| + |4y| + |48 - 3x - 4y| = 48. Since all the terms are absolute values, the expression inside the first two absolute values is already non-negative, so the first two terms are just |3x| and |4y|. The third term is |48 - 3x - 4y|. So, the equation is the sum of the absolute values of three linear expressions. To simplify, maybe I can consider different cases based on the signs of 3x, 4y, and 48 - 3x - 4y.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nCase 1: 3x ≥ 0, 4y ≥ 0, 48 - 3x - 4y ≥ 0\n\nCase 2: 3x ≥ 0, 4y ≥ 0, 48 - 3x - 4y < 0\n\nCase 3: 3x ≥ 0, 4y < 0, 48 - 3x - 4y ≥ 0\n\nCase 4: 3x ≥ 0, 4y < 0, 48 - 3x - 4y < 0\n\nCase 5: 3x < 0, 4y ≥ 0, 48 - 3x - 4y ≥ 0\n\nCase 6: 3x < 0, 4y ≥ 0, 48 - 3x - 4y < 0\n\nCase 7: 3x < 0, 4y < 0, 48 - 3x - 4y ≥ 0\n\nCase 8: 3x < 0, 4y < 0, 48 - 3x - 4y < 0\n\nEach of these cases will have different absolute value expressions, so the equation will be different in each case. Let me try to solve each case step by step.\n\nStarting with Case 1: 3x ≥ 0, 4y ≥ 0, 48 - 3x - 4y ≥ 0\n\nIn this case, all terms are non-negative. So, the equation becomes:\n\n|3x| + |4y| + |48 - 3x - 4y| = 48\n\nSince 3x ≥ 0 and 4y ≥ 0, |3x| = 3x, |4y| = 4y. Also, 48 - 3x - 4y ≥ 0. Let me note that 48 - 3x - 4y ≥ 0 implies that 48 ≥ 3x + 4y.

Each day, he picks one cookie uniformly at random, eats it, and then all remaining cookies that are labeled with a subset of that cookie. The problem is asking for the expected number of days until all cookies are gone, which can be expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then finding m + n. Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the problem. Each cookie is labeled with a subset of the 8-element set. Since there are 2^8 - 1 = 255 cookies, each labeled with a unique subset. The subsets are all nonempty, so the total number of subsets is 2^8 = 256, but since we exclude the empty set, there are 255. So each cookie is labeled with a unique subset, and the subsets are all possible nonempty subsets of {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}.\n\nNow, when Kevin eats a cookie, he eats it and all remaining cookies that are labeled with a subset of that cookie. So, for example, if he eats the cookie labeled with {1,2}, he eats that cookie and all remaining cookies labeled with {1}, {2}, {1,2}, {3}, {4}, {5}, {6}, {7}, {8}, {1,3}, {1,4}, ..., {1,8}, {2,3}, {2,4}, ..., {2,8}, {3,4}, ..., {3,8}, ..., {7,8}. Wait, but the subsets are all nonempty, so the cookie labeled {1,2} would include all subsets that contain both 1 and 2. So, for example, {1,2}, {1,3}, {1,4}, ..., {1,8}, {2,3}, {2,4}, ..., {2,8}, {3,4}, ..., {3,8}, ..., {7,8}.\n\nSo, when he eats a cookie labeled with a subset S, he eats S and all subsets of S. Therefore, the number of cookies he eats on that day is equal to the number of subsets of S. Since each subset is unique, the number of cookies he eats is equal to the number of subsets of S. Therefore, the number of days he eats a cookie is equal to the number of subsets of S. So, the expected number of days is equal to the average number of subsets of all possible nonempty subsets of {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}.\n\nBut how do we compute this average? Let's think. Each subset S has a certain number of subsets, which is 2^(|S| - 1), where |S| is the number of elements in S. So, for example, the empty set has 1 subset, {1} has 2 subsets, {1,2} has 4 subsets, etc. Therefore, the total number of subsets is the sum over all nonempty subsets S of 2^(|S| - 1).

We need to find the smallest \\( n \\) where, no matter how we pick six numbers from the set, there will always be two numbers where one divides the other. This is similar to the pigeonhole principle, but with divisibility instead of equality.\n\nLet's start by considering small values of \\( n \\) and see if we can find a set where six numbers don't have any pair where one divides the other.

There's only one number, so there are no six numbers. So, \\( n = 1 \\) is trivially satisfied.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. The equation is a linear equation, which means that the variable x is being multiplied by a coefficient (5) and then added to a constant (3). To find the value of x, I need to isolate it on one side of the equation. That usually involves moving all the constants to one side and the variable term to the other.\n\nLet me start by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation. That will eliminate the 3 on the left side. So, 3 + 5x - 3 = 28 - 3. Let me do that step by step. First, 3 minus 3 is 0, so that cancels out on the left side. Then, 5x minus 0 is still 5x. On the right side, 28 minus 3 is 25. So after subtracting 3, the equation becomes 5x = 25. Okay, now that's simpler. So, 5x equals 25. To solve for x, I need to divide both sides by 5. Let me do that. 5x divided by 5 is x, and 25 divided by 5 is 5. So, x = 5. Let me check if that's correct by plugging it back into the original equation. If x is 5, then 3 + 5*5 = 3 + 25 = 28.

The ratio of the area of triangle QRS to the area of triangle QOP is 9:25. I need to figure out what Q, R, S, and O are, and then use that information to solve for b.\n\nFirst, let me recall that the area of a triangle is given by (base * height)/2. So, the ratio of the areas would be equal to the ratio of the bases or heights. Since the ratio is 9:25, maybe the ratio of the bases or heights is 9:25. Hmm, but the problem doesn't mention any triangles other than QRS and QOP. Wait, maybe QRS is a triangle formed by points R, S, and Q, and QOP is a triangle formed by points Q, O, and P. Let me check the figure again. The line y = b - x intersects the y-axis at P, which is the point where x = 0. So, substituting x = 0 into the equation gives y = b - 0 = b. Therefore, point P is (0, b). The line x = 4 intersects the line y = b - x at point S. To find S, substitute x = 4 into y = b - x. So, y = b - 4. Therefore, point S is (4, b - 4). So, points P and S are (0, b) and (4, b - 4), respectively.\n\nNow, the problem mentions triangle QRS and triangle QOP. Let me try to identify the coordinates of Q, R, S, and O. Since the figure is not provided, I need to assume that Q is a point on the line y = b - x, and R and S are points on the x-axis and y-axis, respectively. Let me think. The line y = b - x intersects the y-axis at P (0, b) and the x-axis at S (4, b - 4). So, the x-intercept is at x = 4, which is point S. The y-intercept is at y = b, which is point P. So, the line y = b - x passes through these two points. Therefore, Q must be a point on this line. Let me denote Q as (q, b - q), where q is the x-coordinate of Q.

Hmm, let me start by breaking it down step by step. First, I should handle the numerator and the denominator separately. Let's start with the numerator: 9 × 9 minus 2 × 2. That's straightforward multiplication first. 9 times 9 is 81, and 2 times 2 is 4. So subtracting 4 from 81 gives 77. Then, the denominator is 1/12 minus 1/19. To subtract these fractions, I need a common denominator. The denominators are 12 and 19, so the least common denominator (LCD) would be 12 × 19 = 228. Let me convert each fraction to have this denominator. For 1/12, multiplying numerator and denominator by 19 gives 19/228. For 1/19, multiplying numerator and denominator by 12 gives 12/228. So now, subtracting 12/228 from 19/228 gives 7/228. So the entire expression simplifies to 77 divided by 7/228. Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so that would be 77 multiplied by 228/7. Let me compute that. 77 divided by 7 is 11, so 11 multiplied by 228. Let me calculate 11 × 228. 11 × 200 is 2200, 11 × 28 is 308, so 2200 + 308 is 2508. So the answer should be 2508. Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, numerator: 9 × 9 is 81, 2 × 2 is 4, so 81 - 4 is 77. Then denominator: 1/12 - 1/19. LCD is 228, so 19/228 - 12/228 = 7/228. Then 77 divided by 7/228 is 77 × 228/7. 77 divided by 7 is 11, so 11 × 228. Let me compute 11 × 200 = 2200, 11 × 28 = 308, so 2200 + 308 = 2508. Yep, that seems right. So the answer is 2508. Let me just double-check with a calculator to be sure. 9×9 is 81, 2×2 is 4, so 81-4 is 77. Then 1/12 - 1/19. LCD is 228, 19/228 - 12/228 = 7/228. Then 77 divided by 7 is 11, so 11×228=2508.

Maybe I can rearrange terms to group variables. Let's see:\n\nx² - (8 sin θ + cos θ + 1)y = 4 sin θ - 2 cos θ + 6\n\nSo, the left side is a quadratic in y, and the right side is a quadratic in x. Maybe I can treat this as a quadratic equation in y and solve for y.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express y in terms of x and θ. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote the left side as L and the right side as R:\n\nL = x² - (8 sin θ + cos θ + 1)y\n\nR = 4 sin θ - 2 cos θ + 6\n\nSo, L = R + (8 sin θ + cos θ + 1)y\n\nTherefore, (8 sin θ + cos θ + 1)y = L - R\n\nLet me compute L - R:\n\nx² - (8 sin θ + cos θ + 1)y - (4 sin θ - 2 cos θ - 6) = 0\n\nSo, (8 sin θ + cos θ + 1)y = x² - (4 sin θ - 2 cos θ - 6)\n\nTherefore, y = [x² - (4 sin θ - 2 cos θ - 6)] / (8 sin θ + cos θ + 1)\n\nSo, the family of curves can be written as:\n\ny = [x² - (4 sin θ - 2 cos θ - 6)] / (8 sin θ + cos θ + 1)\n\nHmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can simplify this expression.

Since we need numbers that are divisible by 2, 3, 4, and 5, the LCM of these numbers will give us the smallest number that is divisible by all of them. Then, we can figure out how many numbers up to 100 are multiples of that LCM. But wait, the problem says \"the number of integers that can be divided by 2, 3, 4, 5\".

Because if there are numbers divisible by two or more but not all four, then they would be excluded from the count.\n\nLet me recall that the LCM of 2, 3, 4, and 5 is 60. So, numbers divisible by 60 are the multiples of 60 up to 100. Let's check: 60, 120 is beyond 100, so there's only one multiple of 60 in the range 1-100. But wait, 60 is divisible by 2, 3, 4, and 5. So, 60 is the only number in that range that is divisible by all four. Therefore, the number of integers that can be divided by 2, 3, 4, 5 is 1. So, the answer should be B) 1.\n\nBut let me double-check my reasoning. If a number is divisible by 2, 3, 4, and 5, then it must be divisible by their LCM, which is 60. But since 60 is the only number in the range 1-100 that is divisible by all four, then the answer should indeed be 1. But wait, the problem says \"the number of integers that can be divided by 2, 3, 4, 5\".

The problem states that α + β is less than π, and I need to compute cosα. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a circle, the length of a chord is related to the central angle and the radius. The formula for the length of a chord is 2r sin(θ/2), where θ is the central angle. So, if I can relate the chord lengths to the central angles, maybe I can find the radius first and then compute cosα.\n\nLet me start with the chord of length 2. Let's denote the central angle corresponding to this chord as α. Then, according to the formula, 2r sin(α/2) = 2. So, solving for r, we get r = 1 / sin(α/2). Similarly, for the chord of length 3, the central angle is β, so 2r sin(β/2) = 3, which gives r = 3 / (2 sin(β/2)). And for the chord of length 4, the central angle is α + β, so 2r sin((α + β)/2) = 4, which simplifies to r = 2 / sin((α + β)/2).\n\nNow, since all three chords are chords of the same circle, the radius r must be the same for all three. Therefore, the three expressions for r must be equal. So, we can set up the following equations:\n\n1. r = 1 / sin(α/2)\n2. r = 3 / (2 sin(β/2))\n3. r = 2 / sin((α + β)/2)\n\nSince all these expressions equal r, we can set them equal to each other. Let's write them out:\n\n1. 1 / sin(α/2) = 3 / (2 sin(β/2))\n2. 1 / sin(α/2) = 2 / sin((α + β)/2)\n\nFrom equation 1, we can solve for sin(β/2):\n\nsin(β/2) = 3 / (2 sin(α/2))\n\nSimilarly, from equation 2, we can solve for sin((α + β)/2):\n\nsin((α + β)/2) = 2 / sin(α/2)\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\nsin(β/2) = 3 / (2 sin(α/2))\n\nsin((α + β)/2) = 2 / sin(α/2)\n\nWe also know that α + β < π, which means that the sum of the central angles is less than π. Since α and β are central angles, their sum is less than π, so α + β < π. Therefore, (α + β)/2 < π/2, which implies that sin((α + β)/2) > 0. So, sin((α + β)/2) is positive, which is good.\n\nNow, let's denote sin(α/2) as x. Then, from equation 1, sin(β/2) = 3 / (2x). From equation 2, sin((α + β)/2) = 2 / x.

Each problem is scored by three teachers, with each giving 0 or 1 point. The computer rounds the arithmetic mean of the three scores to the nearest integer. The total score is the sum of all problems. The question is asking for the highest possible total score given the constraints.\n\nFirst, let's consider the scoring system. Each problem is scored by three teachers. For a problem, the three scores are 0, 0, and 1. The arithmetic mean of these three scores is (0 + 0 + 1)/3 = 1/3 ≈ 0.333. When rounded to the nearest integer, this would be 0. However, the problem states that the computer rounds to the nearest integer. Since 0.333 is closer to 0 than to 1, the score for that problem would be 0. But the question says \"the points received for all problems are then summed.\" So, even though the arithmetic mean is 0.333, the computer rounds it to 0. Therefore, each problem is scored 0.\n\nBut the problem states that in one of the papers, each of the three experts gave 1 point for 3 problems and 0 points for all other problems. So, for each problem, two of the three teachers gave 1 point and one gave 0. The arithmetic mean would be (1 + 1 + 0)/3 = 2/3 ≈ 0.666. When rounded to the nearest integer, this would be 1. Therefore, each problem is scored 1.\n\nBut the question is asking for the highest possible total score for this paper. Since each problem is scored 1, the total score would be 1 * number of problems. However, the problem doesn't specify the number of problems. But since the question is about the highest possible total score, and each problem is scored 1, the total score would be 1 * number of problems.

Each paper is independently checked by three teachers, and each gives 0 or 1 point for each problem. Then the computer finds the arithmetic mean of the scores for that problem and rounds it to the nearest integer. The points received for all problems are then summed. It so happened that in one of the papers, each of the three experts gave 1 point for 3 problems and 0 points for all other problems. Find the highest possible total score for this paper.\n\n<think>\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\nThe highest possible total score for this paper would be 9. Let me think. Each problem is scored by three teachers, with each giving 0 or 1 point. The computer rounds the arithmetic mean of the three scores to the nearest integer. The total score is the sum of all problems. The question is asking for the highest possible total score given the constraints.\n\nFirst, let's consider the scoring system. Each problem is scored by three teachers. For a problem, the three scores are 0, 0, and 1. The arithmetic mean of these three scores is (0 + 0 + 1)/3 = 1/3 ≈ 0.333. When rounded to the nearest integer, this would be 0. However, the problem states that the computer rounds to the nearest integer. Since 0.333 is closer to 0 than to 1, the score for that problem would be 0. But the question says \"the points received for all problems are then summed.\" So, even though the arithmetic mean is 0.333, the computer rounds it to 0. Therefore, each problem is scored 0.\n\nBut the problem states that in one of the papers, each of the three experts gave 1 point for 3 problems and 0 points for all other problems. So, for each problem, two of the three teachers gave 1 point and one gave 0. The arithmetic mean would be (1 + 1 + 0)/3 = 2/3 ≈ 0.666. When rounded to the nearest integer, this would be 1. Therefore, each problem is scored 1.\n\nBut the question is asking for the highest possible total score for this paper. Since each problem is scored 1, the total score would be 1 * number of problems. However, the problem doesn't specify the number of problems. But since the question is about the highest possible total score, and each problem is scored 1, the total score would be 1 * number of problems.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the function. The absolute value function |x² - 4| is a bit tricky because it's a quadratic inside, so it's going to have a V-shape. The expression inside the absolute value, x² - 4, is a parabola opening upwards with its vertex at x = 0. So, the absolute value function will be symmetric around x = 0, right? Because the vertex of x² - 4 is at x = 0, so the absolute value function will be symmetric about x = 0. That means the maximum of |x² - 4| will occur at x = 0 as well. Let me confirm that.\n\nSo, when x = 0, x² - 4 = 0 - 4 = -4. The absolute value of -4 is 4. So, at x = 0, y = 4. That seems right. But wait, the problem says the maximum of the function y = |x² - 4| - 6x. So, even though the absolute value function has a maximum at x = 0, the entire function y is the absolute value function minus 6x. So, the maximum of y would be the maximum of |x² - 4| minus 6x. Since the absolute value function is always non-negative, the maximum of y would be the maximum of |x² - 4| minus the minimum of 6x (since 6x is a linear function that decreases as x increases). So, the maximum of y would be the maximum of |x² - 4| minus the minimum of 6x. But since the absolute value function is symmetric around x = 0, the maximum of |x² - 4| is 4 at x = 0, and the minimum of 6x is at x = 0 as well, which is 0. So, the maximum of y would be 4 - 0 = 4. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the function is y = |x² - 4| - 6x. The absolute value function |x² - 4| is symmetric around x = 0, so its maximum is at x = 0, which is 4. Then, the term -6x is a linear function that decreases as x increases.

There were 10 times more 11th graders than 10th graders, and together they scored 4.5 times more points than all the 10th graders. We need to find out how many points the most successful 10th grader scored.\n\nFirst, let's break down the information given. Let's denote the number of 10th graders as x. Then, the number of 11th graders would be 10x. The total number of players is x + 10x = 11x. Each player plays against every other player once, so the total number of games played is C(11x, 2) = 11x * (11x - 1)/2. Since each game results in a total of 2 points (either 2 for a win and 0 for a loss, or 1 for each in a draw), the total points scored in the tournament is 2 * C(11x, 2) = 2 * (11x * (11x - 1)/2) = 11x * (11x - 1). But we know that the total points scored by the 11th graders is 4.5 times the total points scored by the 10th graders. Let's denote the total points scored by the 10th graders as P10 and by the 11th graders as P11. Then, P11 = 4.5 * P10. The total points scored by all players is P10 + P11 = 11x * (11x - 1). Therefore, P11 = 4.5 * P10, so P10 + 4.5 * P10 = 11x * (11x - 1). That simplifies to 5.5 * P10 = 11x * (11x - 1). Let's solve for P10 in terms of x.\n\nDivide both sides by 5.5: P10 = (11x * (11x - 1))/5.5. Let's simplify that. 11x * (11x - 1) is 121x² - 11x. Dividing by 5.5 gives (121x² - 11x)/5.5. Let's compute that. 121x² divided by 5.5 is 23x², and 11x divided by 5.5 is 2x. So, P10 = 23x² - 2x. Therefore, P11 = 4.5 * (23x² - 2x) = 10.35x² - 9x. The total points scored by all players is P10 + P11 = 23x² - 2x + 10.35x² - 9x = 33.35x² - 11x.

The given side AB is 3. Hmm, let me recall some properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nFirst, since ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral, all its vertices lie on the circumference of the circle. The diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular, which is a key property here. The Pythagorean theorem can be applied in different ways depending on the sides of the quadrilateral. Let me think about how to relate the sides and the diagonals.\n\nIn a cyclic quadrilateral, the sum of the products of the opposite sides is equal to the product of the diagonals. That is, AB * CD + BC * DA = AC * BD. But I don't know the lengths of BC and DA. However, since the diagonals are perpendicular, maybe I can use the Pythagorean theorem in the triangles formed by the diagonals.\n\nLet me denote the diagonals as AC = d1 and BD = d2. Since they are perpendicular, the quadrilateral can be divided into four right-angled triangles. Let me consider triangles ABD and BCD. In triangle ABD, sides AB = 3, BD = d2, and diagonal AD. Similarly, in triangle BCD, sides BC = x, BD = d2, and diagonal CD. But I don't know x yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle ABD. Let me denote the length of AD as a. Then, in triangle ABD, AB² + AD² = BD². So, 3² + a² = d2². Similarly, in triangle BCD, BC² + CD² = BD². So, x² + CD² = d2².\n\nBut I need to find CD. Let me try to express x in terms of d2. Since the diagonals are perpendicular, triangle ABD is a right-angled triangle at point B. Therefore, AB² + BD² = AD². So, 3² + d2² = a².

Find the side $CD$, if $AB=3$.\n\n<think>\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\n<think>\nAlright, so I need to find the length of side CD in a quadrilateral ABCD inscribed in a circle with radius 2, where the diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular. The given side AB is 3. Hmm, let me recall some properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nFirst, since ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral, all its vertices lie on the circumference of the circle. The diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular, which is a key property here. The Pythagorean theorem can be applied in different ways depending on the sides of the quadrilateral. Let me think about how to relate the sides and the diagonals.\n\nIn a cyclic quadrilateral, the sum of the products of the opposite sides is equal to the product of the diagonals. That is, AB * CD + BC * DA = AC * BD. But I don't know the lengths of BC and DA. However, since the diagonals are perpendicular, maybe I can use the Pythagorean theorem in the triangles formed by the diagonals.\n\nLet me denote the diagonals as AC = d1 and BD = d2. Since they are perpendicular, the quadrilateral can be divided into four right-angled triangles. Let me consider triangles ABD and BCD. In triangle ABD, sides AB = 3, BD = d2, and diagonal AD. Similarly, in triangle BCD, sides BC = x, BD = d2, and diagonal CD. But I don't know x yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle ABD. Let me denote the length of AD as a. Then, in triangle ABD, AB² + AD² = BD². So, 3² + a² = d2². Similarly, in triangle BCD, BC² + CD² = BD². So, x² + CD² = d2².\n\nBut I need to find CD. Let me try to express x in terms of d2. Since the diagonals are perpendicular, triangle ABD is a right-angled triangle at point B. Therefore, AB² + BD² = AD². So, 3² + d2² = a². Therefore, a² = 9 + d2². Similarly, in triangle BCD, BC² + CD² = BD². So, x² + CD² = d2². Therefore, x² = d2² - CD².\n\nBut I need to relate x to the other sides. Since ABCD is cyclic, the sum of the products of the opposite sides is equal to the product of the diagonals. So, AB * CD + BC * DA = AC * BD. But we don't know BC and DA.

Let me break it down step by step. First, we know that 3/5 of the marbles are blue. That means the rest, which is 2/5, must be red. Then, the number of red marbles is doubled, but the number of blue marbles stays the same. We need to find the new fraction of red marbles after these changes.\n\nLet me start by figuring out the initial number of red marbles. Since the total number of marbles is 1, and 2/5 of them are red, that means there are (2/5)*1 = 2/5 red marbles. Similarly, the blue marbles are 3/5 of the total, so (3/5)*1 = 3/5 blue marbles.\n\nNow, when the number of red marbles is doubled, the new number of red marbles would be 2*(2/5) = 4/5.

But wait, the total number of marbles can't be more than 1. Hmm, that seems impossible. Wait, but the problem says \"the number of red marbles is doubled and the number of blue marbles stays the same\".

We need to find the number of positive integer values of n that satisfy this inequality.\n\nFirst, let's note that the expression inside the absolute value is √(n/(n+2009)). Since n is a positive integer, the denominator n+2009 is also positive, so the expression is well-defined. The square root of a positive number is always positive, so √(n/(n+2009)) is positive. Therefore, the absolute value is just the expression itself, so the inequality simplifies to:\n\n√(n/(n+2009)) - 1 > 1/1005 or √(n/(n+2009)) - 1 < -1/1005\n\nBut since the square root is always non-negative, the first inequality √(n/(n+2009)) - 1 > 1/1005 is always true for positive n, because √(n/(n+2009)) is at least 1/√(n+2009), which is greater than 1/1005. Therefore, the first inequality is always satisfied for all positive integers n.\n\nNow, let's focus on the second inequality: √(n/(n+2009)) - 1 < -1/1005. Let's rearrange this inequality:\n\n√(n/(n+2009)) < 1 - 1/1005\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n1 - 1/1005 = 1004/1005\n\nSo the inequality becomes:\n\n√(n/(n+2009)) < 1004/1005\n\nNow, since the square root is less than 1004/1005, we can square both sides to eliminate the square root. However, we need to be careful because squaring can introduce extraneous solutions.

Since S_1 is just a_1, that would mean a_1 = 2a_1 - 1. Let me solve for a_1. Subtracting 2a_1 from both sides gives -a_1 = -1, so a_1 = 1. Okay, so the first term is 1.\n\nNow, the problem says that the sequence {b_n} satisfies b_1 = 3, and b_{k+1} = a_{k} + b_{k} for k = 1, 2, ... . So, starting with b_1 = 3, each subsequent term is the previous term plus the term before that. So, b_2 = a_1 + b_1, b_3 = a_2 + b_2, and so on. Since a_1 = 1, let's compute the first few terms of {b_n}.\n\nFirst term: b_1 = 3.\n\nSecond term: b_2 = a_1 + b_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThird term: b_3 = a_2 + b_2 = a_2 + 4.\n\nFourth term: b_4 = a_3 + b_3 = a_3 + (a_2 + 4) = a_3 + a_2 + 4.\n\nWait, but a_2 is the sum of the first two terms of {a_n}, which is S_2 = 2a_2 - 1. So, S_2 = a_1 + a_2 = 1 + a_2. Therefore, S_2 = 2a_2 - 1, so 1 + a_2 = 2a_2 - 1. Solving for a_2: a_2 = 2. So, a_2 = 2.\n\nThen, b_3 = a_2 + b_2 = 2 + 4 = 6.\n\nb_4 = a_3 + b_3 = a_3 + 6.\n\nBut a_3 is the sum of the first three terms of {a_n}, which is S_3 = 2a_3 - 1. So, S_3 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 1 + 2 + a_3 = 3 + a_3. Therefore, S_3 = 3 + a_3. But S_3 is also equal to 2a_3 - 1. So, 3 + a_3 = 2a_3 - 1. Solving for a_3: a_3 = 4. So, a_3 = 4.\n\nThen, b_4 = a_3 + b_3 = 4 + 6\n\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant that provides well‑reasoned but short responses.\nYou first briefly think about the reasoning process as an internal monologue and then provide the user with the answer.\nRespond in the following format:\n\nProblem: 1.

Hmm, trigonometric equations can be tricky, but maybe I can use some trigonometric identities to simplify it. Let me recall that 1 - cos x can be rewritten using the double-angle identity. The identity is 1 - cos x = 2 sin²(x/2). Let me try that substitution.\n\nSo, substituting that into the equation:\n\n5(2 sin²(x/2)) = 4 sin x\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\n10 sin²(x/2) = 4 sin x\n\nNow, let me divide both sides by 2 to simplify:\n\n5 sin²(x/2) = 2 sin x\n\nHmm, that's a bit more manageable. Let me let t = sin(x/2). Then, sin²(x/2) = t². So, substituting that in:\n\n5 t² = 2 sin x\n\nBut sin x is equal to 2 sin x / 2, so sin x = 2 t. Therefore, substituting back:\n\n5 t² = 2 * 2 t\n\nSimplify:\n\n5 t² = 4 t\n\nDivide both sides by t (assuming t ≠ 0):\n\n5 t = 4\n\nSo, t = 4/5\n\nBut t = sin(x/2), so sin(x/2) = 4/5. Now, I need to find x. Since t = sin(x/2), I can use the inverse sine function:\n\nx/2 = arcsin(4/5)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\nx = 2 arcsin(4/5)\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's another solution.

Let me start by visualizing the triangle. Triangle ABC has D as the midpoint of BC, which means BD = DC. Then there's an internal point E on AC such that AC is three times CE. So AC = 3CE. Then BE and AD intersect at G. The question is asking for the ratio AG: GD. The options are 2, 3, 3 or 4, or 4. Hmm, let's try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, since D is the midpoint of BC, BD = DC. So BD = DC = (BC)/2. That might be useful later. Also, AC = 3CE. So if AC is 3CE, then CE is 1/3 of AC. So CE = AC/3. Then AE = AC - CE = AC - AC/3 = 2AC/3. So AE is twice the length of CE. That might help in some coordinate geometry approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using mass points or coordinate geometry. Let me think about coordinate geometry. Let me place the triangle in a coordinate system to make calculations easier.\n\nLet me set point A at the origin (0,0). Let me assign coordinates to the other points. Let me let BC be the base of the triangle. Let me let point B be at (0,0) and point C be at (2a, 0) since D is the midpoint of BC. Then point A is at (0, h), where h is the height of the triangle. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the height. Hmm, maybe I need to find the coordinates of all points.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using mass points. Let me assign masses to the points. Let's assign mass 1 to point B and mass 1 to point C. Since D is the midpoint of BC, the mass at D would be 1 + 1 = 2. Then point A is at (0, h), but again, the height h is not specified. Hmm, maybe I need to find h.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using coordinate geometry. Let me place point A at (0,0), point B at (0, h), and point C at (2a, 0). Then point D is the midpoint of BC, so D is at (a, 0). Then point E is on AC such that AC = 3CE. So if AC is 3CE, then CE is 1/3 of AC. So CE = (1/3)AC. Then AE = AC - CE = AC - (1/3)AC = (2/3)AC. So AE = (2/3)AC. Since AC is 3CE, AC = 3CE. So AC = 3*(1/3)AC = AC. So that's consistent. Then AE = (2/3)AC. So AE is twice the length of CE. So CE = (1/3)AC, AE = (2/3)AC. So AE is twice CE. So point E divides AC in the ratio 2:1. So E is at (2a, 0) + (1/3)(2a, 0) = (2a + 2a/3, 0) = (8a/3, 0). So E is at (8a/3, 0).\n\nNow, BE and AD intersect at G.

Let me rewrite this as \\(\\frac{c^{1/2}}{(a+b)^{n/4} \\cdot a^{2-n} \\cdot b^{3/4}}\\). So, the numerator is \\(c^{1/2}\\), and the denominator is \\((a+b)^{n/4} \\cdot a^{2-n} \\cdot b^{3/4}\\). Now, I need to raise this entire fraction to the power of 4/3. So, the entire expression becomes \\(\\left(\\frac{c^{1/2}}{(a+b)^{n/4} \\cdot a^{2-n} \\cdot b^{3/4}}\\right)^{4/3}\\).\n\nSimilarly, the second fraction is \\(\\frac{b^{3} c^{4}}{(a+b)^{2 n} a^{16-8 n}}\\). Let me write this as \\(\\frac{b^{3} c^{4}}{(a+b)^{2 n} \\cdot a^{16-8 n}}\\). Now, I need to raise this to the power of 1/6. So, the entire expression becomes \\(\\left(\\frac{b^{3} c^{4}}{(a+b)^{2 n} \\cdot a^{16-8 n}}\\right)^{1/6}\\).\n\nNow, the problem is to divide the first result by the second result. So, the entire expression is \\(\\left(\\frac{c^{1/2}}{(a+b)^{n/4} \\cdot a^{2-n} \\cdot b^{3/4}}\\right)^{4/3} \\div \\left(\\frac{b^{3} c^{4}}{(a+b)^{2 n} \\cdot a^{16-8 n}}\\right)^{1/6}\\).\n\nTo divide two fractions, I can multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second. So, this becomes \\(\\left(\\frac{c^{1/2}}{(a+b)^{n/4} \\cdot a^{2-n} \\cdot b^{3/\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\n</think>", "e71c071_correct": false}

To find the probability, we need to determine the number of green cubes and divide it by the total number of cubes. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's count the total number of cubes in the box. The problem mentions four colors: pink, blue, green, red, and purple.

Since the axis of symmetry is parallel to the y-axis, the parabola opens either upwards or downwards. However, the problem states that the parabola passes through the points \\((1,0)\\) and \\((4,0)\\), which are symmetric about the axis of symmetry. Therefore, the axis of symmetry must be the vertical line halfway between \\(x = 1\\) and \\(x = 4\\), which is \\(x = \\frac{1+4}{2} = 2.5\\). So, the axis of symmetry is \\(x = 2.5\\), and the vertex must be at \\(x = 2.5\\).

Since the axis of symmetry is parallel to the y-axis, the parabola opens either upwards or downwards. However, the problem states that the parabola passes through the points \\((1,0)\\) and \\((4,0)\\), which are symmetric about the axis of symmetry. Therefore, the axis of symmetry must be the vertical line halfway between \\(x = 1\\) and \\(x = 4\\), which is \\(x = \\frac{1+4}{2} = 2.5\\). So, the axis of symmetry is \\(x = 2.5\\), and the vertex must be at \\(x = 2.5\\). Therefore, the equation can be written as \\( y = a(x - 2.5)^2 + k \\).\n\nNext, we need to find the value of \\(a\\) and \\(k\\).

Then, I have to find the minimum value of a specific expression involving these angles. Let me start by understanding the given equation first.\n\nThe equation is: sin α · cos β + |cos α · sin β| = sin α · |cos α| + |sin β| · cos β. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated with absolute values and different signs. Maybe I can simplify it by considering different cases based on the signs of the terms inside the absolute values. Let me think.\n\nFirst, let's note that the absolute value of a product is equal to the product of the absolute values. So, |cos α · sin β| = |cos α| · |sin β|. Similarly, |sin β| · cos β = |sin β| · |cos β|. Therefore, the equation can be rewritten as:\n\nsin α · cos β + |cos α| · |sin β| = sin α · |cos α| + |sin β| · |cos β|\n\nLet me rearrange terms to group similar terms:\n\nsin α · cos β - sin α · |cos α| = |sin β| · |cos β| - |cos α| · |sin β|\n\nFactor out sin α on the left side:\n\nsin α (cos β - |cos α|) = |sin β| · |cos β| - |cos α| · |sin β|\n\nSimilarly, factor out |sin β| on the right side:\n\nsin α (cos β - |cos α|) = |sin β| (|cos β| - |cos α|)\n\nSo, the equation simplifies to:\n\nsin α (cos β - |cos α|) = |sin β| (|cos β| - |cos α|)\n\nHmm, interesting. Let me denote |cos α| as c and |sin β| as s. Then, the equation becomes:\n\nsin α (c - c) = s (s - c)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n0 = s (s - c)\n\nSo, either s = 0 or s = c. But since s = |sin β|, which is always non-negative, the only possibility is s = 0. Therefore, |sin β| = 0, which implies sin β = 0. Therefore, β must be an integer multiple of π. So, β = kπ for some integer k.\n\nSimilarly, c = |cos α|, which is also non-negative. So, |cos α| = c. Therefore, cos α = ±c. So, α must be an odd multiple of π/2. So, α = (2m + 1)π/2 for some integer m.\n\nTherefore, the angles α, β, γ are either α = (2m + 1)π/2, β = kπ, and γ is arbitrary. But since we need to find the minimum value of (tan γ - sin α)^2 + (cot γ - cos β)^2, we need to consider the possible values of γ. However, the problem doesn't specify γ, so perhaps we can assume γ is arbitrary. But since the expression is symmetric in γ, the minimum value should be the same regardless of γ. So, we can set γ = 0 for simplicity.\n\nTherefore, the expression becomes (tan 0 - sin (2m + 1)π/2)^2 + (cot 0 - cos kπ)^2.\n\nLet's compute each term:\n\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant that provides well‑reasoned but short responses.\nYou first briefly think about the reasoning process as an internal monologue and then provide the user with the answer.\nRespond in the following format:\n\nProblem: 5.

The function is defined differently depending on whether y² + z² is zero or not. Hmm, partial derivatives are usually found by treating all variables except one as constants. So, I need to consider two cases: when y² + z² ≠ 0 and when y² + z² = 0. Let me start with the first case, where y² + z² ≠ 0. The function is f(x, y, z) = x⁴ + (2xyz)/(y² + z²). To find the partial derivative with respect to x, I'll treat y and z as constants. So, the derivative with respect to x is 4x³ + (2yz)/(y² + z²). Then, for the partial derivative with respect to y, I'll treat x and z as constants. The derivative with respect to y is 2x²z/(y² + z²). Similarly, for the partial derivative with respect to z, I'll treat x and y as constants. The derivative with respect to z is 2x²y/(y² + z²). So, the partial derivatives are:\n\n∂f/∂x = 4x³ + 2yz/(y² + z²)\n\n∂f/∂y = 2x²z/(y² + z²)\n\n∂f/∂z = 2x²y/(y² + z²)\n\nNow, let's check the second case, where y² + z² = 0.

So, the partial derivatives in this case are:\n\n∂f/∂x = 0\n\n∂f/∂y = 0\n\n∂f/∂z = 0\n\nTherefore, the partial derivatives at point A(1,0,0) are the same as in the first case. Let me verify that.

First, I remember that the equation of a tangent line to a curve at a specific point is given by y = f'(x₀)(x - x₀) + f(x₀), where f is the function, x₀ is the x-coordinate of the point, and f'(x₀) is the derivative evaluated at x₀.

The derivative of x² is 2x, and the derivative of -4x is -4. So, the derivative f'(x) is 2x - 4. Then, at x₀ = 1, the slope of the tangent line is f'(1) = 2*1 - 4 = -2. So, the slope is -2. Then, the point on the parabola at x = 1 is (1, f(1)). Let me compute f(1). Plugging x = 1 into the original equation: y = 1² - 4*1 = 1 - 4 = -3. So, the point is (1, -3). Therefore, the equation of the tangent line should be y = -2(x - 1) - 3. Let me write that out: y = -2x + 2 - 3, which simplifies to y = -2x - 1. So, the equation of the tangent line is y = -2x - 1. Let me check if that's correct. If I plug x = 1 into the tangent line equation, I get y = -2*1 - 1 = -3, which matches the original point. If I take the derivative of the original function at x = 1, which is -2, and plug that into the tangent line equation, I get y = -2*(1) - 1 = -3, which again matches. So, that seems right.

The first condition tells us that the function \\( f \\) must be positive for all primes. The second condition is a divisibility condition involving \\( f(x) \\), \\( f(p) \\), and \\( x \\). Since \\( p \\) is a prime, \\( p \\) divides \\( (f(x) + f(p))^{f(p)} - x \\). This suggests that \\( f(x) + f(p) \\) must be a multiple of \\( p \\), because if \\( p \\) divides \\( (f(x) + f(p))^{f(p)} - x \\), then \\( p \\) divides \\( (f(x) + f(p))^{f(p)} \\), which implies that \\( p \\) divides \\( f(x) + f(p) \\). Therefore, \\( f(x) + f(p) \\) must be divisible by \\( p \\) for all primes \\( p \\) and all integers \\( x \\).\n\nSo, the key here is that \\( f(x) + f(p) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p} \\) for all primes \\( p \\) and all integers \\( x \\). Let me denote this as \\( f(x) + f(p) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p} \\) for all primes \\( p \\) and all integers \\( x \\). This implies that \\( f(x) \\equiv -f(p) \\pmod{p} \\) for all primes \\( p \\) and all integers \\( x \\). Therefore, \\( f(x) \\) must be congruent to \\( -f(p) \\) modulo \\( p \\) for all primes \\( p \\). Since this must hold for all primes \\( p \\), it suggests that \\( f(x) \\) is a constant function. Let me check if this is possible.\n\nSuppose \\( f(x) = c \\) for some constant \\( c \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\). Then, for any prime \\( p \\), \\( f(p) = c \\). Then, the first condition \\( f(p) > 0 \\) implies \\( c > 0 \\). The second condition becomes \\( p \\mid (c + c)^c - x \\), which simplifies to \\( p \\mid (2c)^c - x \\). For this to hold for all primes \\( p \\) and all integers \\( x \\), \\( (2c)^c \\) must be congruent to \\( x \\) modulo \\( p \\) for all primes \\( p \\) and all integers \\( x \\). However, since \\( x \\) can be any integer, this is impossible unless \\( (2c)^c \\equiv x \\pmod{p} \\) for all primes \\( p \\) and all integers \\( x \\). But \\( (2c)^c \\) is a constant, so it can't be congruent to any integer \\( x \\) modulo \\( p \\) for all primes \\( p \\).

Since \\( p \\) is a prime, \\( p \\) divides \\( (f(x) + f(p))^{f(p)} - x \\). This suggests that \\( f(x) + f(p) \\) must be a multiple of \\( p \\), because if \\( p \\) divides \\( (f(x) + f(p))^{f(p)} - x \\), then \\( p \\) divides \\( (f(x) + f(p))^{f(p)} \\), which implies that \\( p \\) divides \\( f(x) + f(p) \\). Therefore, \\( f(x) + f(p) \\) must be divisible by \\( p \\) for all primes \\( p \\) and all integers \\( x \\).\n\nSo, the key here is that \\( f(x) + f(p) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p} \\) for all primes \\( p \\) and all integers \\( x \\). Let me denote this as \\( f(x) + f(p) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p} \\) for all primes \\( p \\) and all integers \\( x \\). This implies that \\( f(x) \\equiv -f(p) \\pmod{p} \\) for all primes \\( p \\) and all integers \\( x \\). Therefore, \\( f(x) \\) must be congruent to \\( -f(p) \\) modulo \\( p \\) for all primes \\( p \\). Since this must hold for all primes \\( p \\), it suggests that \\( f(x) \\) is a constant function. Let me check if this is possible.\n\nSuppose \\( f(x) = c \\) for some constant \\( c \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\). Then, for any prime \\( p \\), \\( f(p) = c \\). Then, the first condition \\( f(p) > 0 \\) implies \\( c > 0 \\). The second condition becomes \\( p \\mid (c + c)^c - x \\), which simplifies to \\( p \\mid (2c)^c - x \\). For this to hold for all primes \\( p \\) and all integers \\( x \\), \\( (2c)^c \\) must be congruent to \\( x \\) modulo \\( p \\) for all primes \\( p \\) and all integers \\( x \\). However, since \\( x \\) can be any integer, this is impossible unless \\( (2c)^c \\equiv x \\pmod{p} \\) for all primes \\( p \\) and all integers \\( x \\). But \\( (2c)^c \\) is a constant, so it can't be congruent to any integer \\( x \\) modulo \\( p \\) for all primes \\( p \\). Therefore, the only way this can hold is if \\( c = 0 \\), but then the first condition \\( f(p) > 0 \\) would require \\( c > 0 \\\n\n<answer>\nThe function \\( f \\) must be a constant function. Therefore, the answer is that the only function \\( f: \\mathbb{Z} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z} \\) that satisfies the given conditions is \\( f(x) = 0 \\) for all \\( x \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\). This is because if \\( f \\) were not constant, the divisibility condition would require \\( f(x) + f(p) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p} \\) for all primes \\( p \\) and all integers \\( x \\), which is impossible unless \\( f(x) \\equiv -f(p) \\pmod{p} \\) for all primes \\( p \\), leading to \\( f(x) = 0 \\) as the only solution. Therefore, the answer is \\( f(x) = 0 \\).You first briefly think about the reasoning process as an internal monologue and then provide the user with the answer.\nYou first briefly think about the reasoning process as an internal monologue and then provide the user with the answer.\nProblem: \nOpgave 4.

However, since we are dealing with angles in the standard position, β can be expressed as π/2 + kπ. But since we are looking for tan(α - β), and tan(α - β) is tan(α - (π/2 + kπ)) = tan(α - π/2 - kπ). Let me recall that tan(θ - π/2) = -cot θ. Therefore, tan(α - β) = tan(α - π/2 - kπ) = -cot(α - π/2 - kπ). But since cotangent is periodic with period π, cot(θ) = cot(θ + π). Therefore, cot(α - π/2 - kπ) = cot(α - π/2). So, tan(α - β) = -cot(α - π/2). Therefore, tan(α - β) = -cot(α - π/2). But cotangent is the reciprocal of tangent, so cot(θ) = 1/tan(θ).

Since the boxes are arranged in a row, the order in which the balls are placed matters. Therefore, this is a problem of distributing n identical objects into r distinct boxes, which is a classic combinatorial problem.\n\nThe formula for this is given by the combination with repetition, which is C(n + r - 1, r - 1). Let me recall that formula. The number of ways to distribute n identical objects into r distinct boxes is equal to the number of ways to choose r - 1 positions in a sequence of n + r - 1 positions, where the first position is fixed as the starting point of the sequence. This is because once we choose r - 1 positions, the remaining n objects can be placed in any of the r positions, but since the boxes are distinct, the order of the boxes matters.\n\nAlternatively, this can be thought of as the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation x1 + x2 + ... + xr = n, where xi represents the number of balls in the i-th box.

The number of ways to choose r - 1 positions for the bars from these total positions is C(n + r - 1, r - 1).\n\nTherefore, the answer is C(n + r - 1, r - 1). Let me verify this with a small example.

First, I need to recall the formulas for the volumes of a cone and a cylinder. The volume of a cone is (1/3)πr²h, and the volume of a cylinder is πr²h. The problem states that the inverted cone is full of water, which is then poured into a cylinder. The key here is that the cone is inverted, so when it's poured into the cylinder, the water will fill the cylinder up to a certain height. The radius of the cylinder is given as 24 cm, and the radius of the cone's base is 12 cm. The height of the cone is 18 cm. Since the cone is inverted, the water will fill the cylinder up to a height that corresponds to the cone's volume. Therefore, I need to calculate the volume of the cone and then determine what height of the cylinder corresponds to that volume.\n\nFirst, let me compute the volume of the cone. The formula is (1/3)πr²h. Plugging in the values: radius r is 12 cm, height h is 18 cm. So the volume of the cone is (1/3)π*(12)²*(18). Let me calculate that step by step.\n\nFirst, compute 12 squared: 12*12 = 144. Then multiply by 18: 144*18. To make this easier, I can break it down. 144*10 = 1440, and 144*8 = 1152. Adding those together: 1440 + 1152 = 2592. Then multiply by 1/3: 2592/3 = 864. So the volume of the cone is 864π cubic centimeters.\n\nNow, the volume of the cylinder is πr²h. The radius of the cylinder is 24 cm, and the height is the height of the water in the cylinder, which we need to find. Let's call that height h. The volume of the cylinder is π*(24)²*h = π*576*h. Since the volume of the water is equal to the volume of the cone, we can set these two volumes equal to each other:\n\nπ*(24)²*h = 864π\n\nI can cancel out π from both sides since π is a common factor. Then, 24²*h = 864. Calculate 24 squared: 24*24 = 576. So 576*h = 864. To find h, divide both sides by 576: h = 864/576. Let me compute that. 864 divided by 576. Both numbers are divisible by 24: 864 ÷ 24 = 36, and 576 ÷ 24 = 24. So 36*24 = 864. Therefore, h = 24. Wait, 864 divided by 576 is 24. So the height of the water in the cylinder is 24 cm.

Hmm, let me start by visualizing the problem. There's a triangle ABC, and points M, N, P, R, S, T on sides AB, BC, CA, MN, NP, PM respectively. The ratios AM/MB = BN/NC = CP/PA = k, and MR/RN = NS/SP = PT/TN = 1 - k. The goal is to show that triangle STR is similar to ABC, and then find the k that minimizes the area of STR.\n\nFirst, let me recall that two triangles are similar if their corresponding angles are equal. So, if triangle STR is similar to ABC, then their corresponding angles must be equal. That means that angles at S, R, T in triangle STR should correspond to angles at A, B, C in triangle ABC. So, maybe I can use the Law of Sines or Cosines to relate the sides and angles.\n\nLet me start by assigning coordinates to the triangle ABC. Let me place point A at the origin (0,0), point B at (1,0), and point C at (0,1). This is a standard coordinate system where triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle at A.

Hmm, let me start by visualizing the problem. There's a triangle ABC, and points M, N, P, R, S, T on sides AB, BC, CA, MN, NP, PM respectively. The ratios AM/MB = BN/NC = CP/PA = k, and MR/RN = NS/SP = PT/TN = 1 - k. The goal is to show that triangle STR is similar to ABC, and then find the k that minimizes the area of STR.\n\nFirst, let me recall that two triangles are similar if their corresponding angles are equal. So, if triangle STR is similar to ABC, then their corresponding angles must be equal. That means that angles at S, R, T in triangle STR should correspond to angles at A, B, C in triangle ABC. So, maybe I can use the Law of Sines or Cosines to relate the sides and angles.\n\nLet me start by assigning coordinates to the triangle ABC. Let me place point A at the origin (0,0), point B at (1,0), and point C at (0,1). This is a standard coordinate system where triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle at A. Then, points M, N, P, R, S, T can be determined based on the given ratios.\n\nFirst, let's find the coordinates of M, N, P. Since AM/MB = k, point M divides AB in the ratio k:1.

Let's start with a = 1. Then the equation becomes (1!)(b!) = 1! + b! + c!. Since 1! = 1, the equation simplifies to b! = 1 + b! + c!. Subtracting b! from both sides gives 0 = 1 + c!, which is impossible because c! is a positive integer. So a = 1 is not possible. Next, a = 2. Then the equation becomes (2!)(b!) = 2! + b! + c!. Let's compute the left side: 2! = 2, so the equation is 2b! = 2 + b! + c!. Subtracting b! from both sides gives b! = 2 + c!. So c! = b! - 2.

Let me start with the numerator: (4 - log_{36} 4 - log_6 18). Then, the denominator is log_4 3. The remaining part is the product of the two simplified parts. Let me handle the numerator first.\n\nStarting with the first term: 4. That's straightforward. The second term is log_{36} 4. To simplify this, I need to express 4 as a power of 36. Since 36 is 6 squared (36 = 6^2), I can write 4 as 6^2. So, log_{36} 4 becomes log_{6^2} 6^2. Using the logarithm power rule, log_b (a^c) = c * log_b a. Therefore, log_{6^2} 6^2 = 2 * log_{6^2} 6. But log_{6^2} 6 is the same as log_{6^2} 6^1, which is 1. So, log_{36} 4 simplifies to 2 * 1 = 2. Therefore, the numerator becomes 4 - 2 - log_6 18. Let me compute that.\n\n4 - 2 is 2. So, the numerator simplifies to 2 - log_6 18. Now, the denominator is log_4 3. Let me recall that log_b a = 1 / log_a b. So, log_4 3 is the reciprocal of log_3 4. Therefore, log_4 3 = 1 / log_3 4. So, the denominator is 1 / log_3 4. Therefore, the entire numerator is 2 - log_6 18, and the denominator is 1 / log_3 4. So, the entire numerator is 2 - log_6 18, and the denominator is 1 / log_3 4. Therefore, the entire expression is (2 - log_6 18) / (1 / log_3 4). Let me simplify this. Dividing by 1 / log_3 4 is the same as multiplying by log_3 4.

Since log_b a + log_b c = log_b (a*c), log_2 3 + log_2 9 = log_2 (3*9) = log_2 27. Since 27 is 3^3, log_2 27 is log_2 (3^3) = 3 * log_2 3. Therefore, the total is 3*log_2 3 + log_2 3 = 4*log_2 3.

Her mother was born on 23.7. (23rd day of July), which would result in an antibirthday of 7.23.

His antibirthday is on the same day as his birthday, which is 3.3. (3rd day of March), so he can't celebrate his antibirthday.\n\nThe question is asking for the number of days in a year where a person can be born such that their antibirthday is on a different day than their birthday. So, we need to find all days in a year where a person can be born such that their antibirthday is on a different day.\n\nFirst, let's note that the antibirthday is created by swapping the day and month numbers. So, for example, if someone is born on 1.1 (1st day of January), their antibirthday would be 1.1 (1st day of January, swapped day and month). Similarly, if someone is born on 12.12 (12th day of December), their antibirthday would be 12.12 (12th day of December, swapped day and month).\n\nTherefore, the key is to find all days where swapping the day and month results in a different day. For example, if someone is born on 1.1, their antibirthday is 1.1, which is the same day. If someone is born on 12.12, their antibirthday is 12.12, which is the same day. So, the only days where swapping the day and month results in a different day are those where the day and month are swapped, but the result is a valid day.\n\nTherefore, the days where a person can be born such that their antibirthday is on a different day are those where the day and month are swapped, but the result is a valid day. So, we need to find all days where the day and month are swapped, and the result is a valid day.\n\nLet's list all possible days in a year. There are 365 days in a year (or 366 in a leap year). Let's consider each day from 1 to 31 (days of the month) and 1 to 12 (months of the year). For each day and month, we swap the day and month, and check if the result is a valid day.\n\nHowever, since the problem is about days in a year, we need to consider all days from 1 to 31 for the day and 1 to 12 for the month.

The variables a, b, c are positive numbers. Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can use some inequalities to simplify it. Let me recall that AM-GM inequality is a good starting point here.\n\nFirst, let's note that all terms in the expression are positive because a, b, c are positive numbers. So, each denominator is positive, and the numerator is a sum of squares. The denominators are quadratic in terms of a, b, c. Let me see if I can apply AM-GM inequality to each term.\n\nLet me consider the first term: (a² + b²)/(c² + ab). Let me denote this as T1.

Let me verify this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's note that the expression is symmetric in a, b, c. Therefore, without loss of generality, we can assume that a ≤ b ≤ c.

Let's denote this as T1 = (a² + b²)/(c² + ab). To find the minimum of T1, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or apply inequalities.

Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, we have point P(m, n) on the hyperbola y = k/x where k > 0. Since m > 0, that's good. Then, a line PA is drawn through P, perpendicular to OP. The line PA intersects the positive x-axis at point A(a, 0) with a > m. The area of triangle OPA is given as S = 1 + n⁴/4, and n is an integer less than 20 with k ≠ n⁴/2. We need to find the minimum value of OP².\n\nLet me recall that OP² is m² + n². So, the problem reduces to finding the minimum value of m² + n² under the given conditions.\n\nFirst, let's figure out the coordinates of point A. Since PA is perpendicular to OP, and OP has slope -k/m (since OP is from the origin to P), the slope of PA should be m/k. So, the equation of line PA can be written as y - n = m/k(x - m). To find the x-intercept A, set y = 0:\n\n0 - n = m/k(x - m) => -n = m/k(x - m) => x - m = -n/k => x = m - n/k\n\nSo, the coordinates of A are (m - n/k, 0). But we are told that A is on the positive x-axis, so a > m. Therefore, m - n/k > m => -n/k > 0 => n/k < 0 => n < 0. But n is given as an integer less than 20, so n is negative. That makes sense because k is positive, so n must be negative. So, n is a negative integer less than 20.\n\nNow, the area of triangle OPA is given by S = 1 + n⁴/4. The base of the triangle is OA, which is from O(0,0) to A(m - n/k, 0). The length of OA is |m - n/k|. The height is the y-coordinate of P, which is n. So, the area S = (1/2) * OA * height = (1/2) * |m - n/k| * n. But S is also given as 1 + n⁴/4. So, we have:\n\n(1/2) * |m - n/k| * n = 1 + n⁴/4\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n|m - n/k| * n = 2 + n⁴/2\n\nLet me rearrange this equation:\n\n|m - n/k| = (2 + n⁴/2)/n\n\nSince |m - n/k| is the absolute value, we can write:\n\n|m - n/k| = (2 + n⁴/2)/n\n\nBut since m > 0 and n < 0, m - n/k must be positive. Therefore, |m - n/k| = m - n/k. So:\n\nm - n/k = (2 + n⁴/2)/n\n\nLet me solve for m:\n\nm = (2 + n⁴/2)/n + n/k\n\nBut m is positive, so this equation must hold.

So, the problem reduces to finding the minimum value of m² + n² under the given conditions.\n\nFirst, let's figure out the coordinates of point A. Since PA is perpendicular to OP, and OP has slope -k/m (since OP is from the origin to P), the slope of PA should be m/k. So, the equation of line PA can be written as y - n = m/k(x - m). To find the x-intercept A, set y = 0:\n\n0 - n = m/k(x - m) => -n = m/k(x - m) => x - m = -n/k => x = m - n/k\n\nSo, the coordinates of A are (m - n/k, 0). But we are told that A is on the positive x-axis, so a > m. Therefore, m - n/k > m => -n/k > 0 => n/k < 0 => n < 0. But n is given as an integer less than 20, so n is negative. That makes sense because k is positive, so n must be negative. So, n is a negative integer less than 20.\n\nNow, the area of triangle OPA is given by S = 1 + n⁴/4. The base of the triangle is OA, which is from O(0,0) to A(m - n/k, 0). The length of OA is |m - n/k|. The height is the y-coordinate of P, which is n. So, the area S = (1/2) * OA * height = (1/2) * |m - n/k| * n. But S is also given as 1 + n⁴/4. So, we have:\n\n(1/2) * |m - n/k| * n = 1 + n⁴/4\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n|m - n/k| * n = 2 + n⁴/2\n\nLet me rearrange this equation:\n\n|m - n/k| = (2 + n⁴/2)/n\n\nSince |m - n/k| is the absolute value, we can write:\n\n|m - n/k| = (2 + n⁴/2)/n\n\nBut since m > 0 and n < 0, m - n/k must be positive.

The line PA is perpendicular to OP, intersecting the positive x-axis at A(a, 0). The area S of triangle OPA is 1 + n⁴/4, and n is an integer < 20 with k ≠ n⁴/2. We need to find the minimum value of OP² = m² + n².\n\nFirst, since P is on the hyperbola, we have n = k/m. So, k = m/n. Then, the slope of OP is -k/m = -m/n. The slope of PA is m/k = m/(m/n) = n. Therefore, the equation of PA is y - n = n(x - m). Setting y = 0 to find the x-intercept A:\n\n0 - n = n(x - m) => -n = n(x - m) => x - m = -1 => x = m - 1.", "e71c071_correct": false}

Each term is (-1) raised to the power of (n-1), which means the sign alternates every time n increases by 1. So, for example, S_1 is 1, S_2 is 1 - 2 = -1, S_3 is -1 + 3 = 2, S_4 is 2 - 4 = -2, and so on.\n\nHmm, maybe I can find a formula for S_n. Let me think. If I consider the sum from n=1 to n=k, then S_k = sum from i=1 to k of (-1)^(i-1)*i. So, S_k = 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + ... + (-1)^(k-1)*k. Let me see if I can find a closed form for this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can split the sum into even and odd terms. Let's see. The terms alternate between positive and negative. So, the sum can be written as the sum of the first k terms where k is even or odd. Let me check.\n\nIf k is even, say k=2m, then the sum is 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + ... + (2m-1) - (2m). If k is odd, say k=2m+1, then the sum is 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + ... + (2m-1) - (2m) + (2m+1). Wait, but in the first case, the last term is (2m-1) - (2m) = -1, which is negative. In the second case, the last term is (2m+1), which is positive. So, depending on whether k is even or odd, the last term is either positive or negative. But in both cases, the sum is the sum of the first k terms with alternating signs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the sum of an alternating series. The sum of an alternating series can be expressed as the difference between the sum of the positive terms and the sum of the negative terms. Let me try that.\n\nLet's denote the sum S_n as the sum from i=1 to n of (-1)^(i-1)*i. Then, S_n = sum_{i=1}^n (-1)^(i-1)*i.

How many birds of each kind were there?\n\n## Problem of John of Palermo.\n\n<think>\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\nAlright, so the problem is about someone buying 30 birds for 30 coins. The catch is that the price is determined by the number of each type of bird: 3 sparrows for 1 coin, 2 doves for 1 coin, and each pigeon for 2 coins. We need to figure out how many of each bird were bought.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the information. The total number of birds is 30, and the total cost is 30 coins. The prices are given per bird type: 3 sparrows for 1 coin, 2 doves for 1 coin, and 2 pigeons for 1 coin. So, the cost per bird is 1/3 for sparrows, 1/2 for doves, and 1/2 for pigeons. That means the cost per bird is 1/3 + 1/2 + 1/2 = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2 coins per bird. So, each bird costs 1.5 coins.\n\nNow, let's denote the number of sparrows as S, doves as D, and pigeons as P. The total number of birds is S + D + P = 30. The total cost is 3S + 2D + 2P = 30 coins. So, we have two equations:\n\n1. S + D + P = 30\n2. 3S + 2D + 2P = 30\n\nWe can solve these equations to find S, D, and P. Let me subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate P:\n\n(3S + 2D + 2P) - (S + D + P) = 30 - 30\n\nWhich simplifies to 2S + D = 0. So, 2S + D = 0. Since S and D are non-negative integers, the only solution is S = 0 and D = 0. But that would mean there are no sparrows or doves, which contradicts the problem statement. So, that can't be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement. Let me check again. The problem says \"for every 3 sparrows, 1 coin was paid, for every 2 doves, also 1 coin, and finally, for each pigeon - 2 coins.\" So, the price per bird is 1/3 for sparrows, 1/2 for doves, and 1/2 for pigeons. Wait, but the problem says \"for every 3 sparrows, 1 coin was paid, for every 2 doves, also 1 coin, and finally, for each pigeon - 2 coins.\" So, the price per bird is 1/3 for sparrows, 1/2 for doves, and 1/2 for pigeons.

Someone bought 30 birds for 30 coins, among these birds, for every 3 sparrows, 1 coin was paid, for every 2 doves, also 1 coin, and finally, for each pigeon - 2 coins. How many birds of each kind were there?\n\n## Problem of John of Palermo.\n\n<think>\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\nAlright, so the problem is about someone buying 30 birds for 30 coins. The catch is that the price is determined by the number of each type of bird: 3 sparrows for 1 coin, 2 doves for 1 coin, and each pigeon for 2 coins. We need to figure out how many of each bird were bought.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the information. The total number of birds is 30, and the total cost is 30 coins. The prices are given per bird type: 3 sparrows for 1 coin, 2 doves for 1 coin, and 2 pigeons for 1 coin. So, the cost per bird is 1/3 for sparrows, 1/2 for doves, and 1/2 for pigeons. That means the cost per bird is 1/3 + 1/2 + 1/2 = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2 coins per bird. So, each bird costs 1.5 coins.\n\nNow, let's denote the number of sparrows as S, doves as D, and pigeons as P. The total number of birds is S + D + P = 30. The total cost is 3S + 2D + 2P = 30 coins. So, we have two equations:\n\n1. S + D + P = 30\n2. 3S + 2D + 2P = 30\n\nWe can solve these equations to find S, D, and P. Let me subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate P:\n\n(3S + 2D + 2P) - (S + D + P) = 30 - 30\n\nWhich simplifies to 2S + D = 0. So, 2S + D = 0. Since S and D are non-negative integers, the only solution is S = 0 and D = 0. But that would mean there are no sparrows or doves, which contradicts the problem statement. So, that can't be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement. Let me check again. The problem says \"for every 3 sparrows, 1 coin was paid, for every 2 doves, also 1 coin, and finally, for each pigeon - 2 coins.\" So, the price per bird is 1/3 for sparrows, 1/2 for doves, and 1/2 for pigeons.

Let me start by visualizing the triangle ABC. It's a right-angled triangle at B, with AB = 3 and BC = 4. Since it's a right-angled triangle, I can use the Pythagorean theorem to find AC. Let me recall that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. So, AC² = AB² + BC². Plugging in the values, AC² = 3² + 4² = 9 + 16 = 25. Therefore, AC = 5. So, the length of AC is 5 units.\n\nNow, points D and E are on AC and BC respectively, such that CD = DE = 5/3. So, CD is 5/3 units, and DE is also 5/3 units. Therefore, the total length of AC is CD + DE = 5/3 + 5/3 = 10/3. So, AC is 10/3 units long.\n\nNow, quadrilateral ABE is formed by points A, B, E, and D. To find its perimeter, I need to calculate the lengths of AB, BE, EA, and DE. Let me start with AB, which is given as 3 units.\n\nNext, BE. Since B is a vertex of the triangle, and E is on BC, which is 4 units long. But BC is the hypotenuse of the right-angled triangle ABC, so BE is part of BC. However, since E is on BC, and BC is 4 units, BE is a segment of BC. But the problem doesn't specify the exact position of E on BC. Hmm, maybe I need to find the coordinates of points A, B, C, D, E to calculate the lengths. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to use similar triangles or coordinate geometry here.\n\nAlternatively, since we have the lengths of AB and BC, and the lengths CD and DE, maybe we can use the concept of similar triangles. Let me think. If CD = DE = 5/3, then the total length of AC is 10/3. So, if we can find the ratio of the sides of triangle ABE to triangle ABC, we can use that ratio to find the lengths of BE and EA.\n\nLet me recall that in a right-angled triangle, the ratio of the sides is the same as the ratio of the hypotenuse to the adjacent side. So, if we can find the ratio of AB to BC, which is 3/4, and then apply that ratio to the sides of triangle ABE.\n\nLet me check. In triangle ABC, AB is 3, BC is 4, so the ratio AB/BC = 3/4. If we apply this ratio to triangle ABE, then the length of BE would be (3/4)*BC = (3/4)*4 = 3. Similarly, EA would be (3/4)*AB = (3/4)*3 = 9/4. Wait, but BE is part of BC, which is 4 units. So, BE = 3 units. Then EA would be 9/4 units. But the perimeter of quadrilateral ABE is AB + BE + EA + DE. Let me compute that.\n\nAB = 3, BE = 3, EA = 9/4, DE = 5/3.

This seems similar to a problem where I need to place six 0's and six 1's in a sequence with the restriction that no three 0's are adjacent.

Alternatively, I can think of placing the 0's and 1's in a way that the number of 0's is less than or equal to the number of 1's plus one. This is because if there are three 0's, they must be separated by at least one 1. Therefore, the maximum number of 0's is equal to the number of 1's plus one. Since there are six 0's and six 1's, the maximum number of 0's is six, which is equal to the number of 1's plus one. Therefore, the number of 0's must be at most six, which is exactly six. So, the problem reduces to arranging six 0's and six 1's such that the number of 0's is six, which is the maximum possible.

The equations are:\n\n1. x + y + z = 2\n2. x³ + y³ + z³ = -10\n\nFirst, let's recall the identity for the sum of cubes: x³ + y³ + z³ - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x² + y² + z² - xy - yz - zx). Plugging in the given values:\n\nx³ + y³ + z³ - 3xyz = 2*(x² + y² + z² - xy - yz - zx)\n\nSo:\n\n-10 - 3xyz = 2*(x² + y² + z² - xy - yz - zx)\n\nLet's rearrange this equation:\n\n-10 - 3xyz = 2(x² + y² + z² - xy - yz - zx)\n\nLet's denote S = x + y + z = 2 and P = xy + yz + zx.

The cube has three faces with 0, two with 1, and one with 2. The expectation is the average of all possible products of the numbers on the two faces. Hmm, let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, since the cube is uniform, each face has an equal chance of landing face up. So, the probability of each face landing up is 1/6. The expectation is calculated by summing up the products of each possible pair of numbers, each multiplied by the probability of that pair occurring.\n\nLet me list all possible pairs of numbers that can appear on the two faces. Since the cube is tossed twice, there are 6 faces, so there are 6 possible pairs. Let me list them:\n\n1. (0,0)\n2. (0,1)\n3. (0,2)\n4. (1,0)\n5. (1,1)\n6. (1,2)\n7. (2,0)\n8. (2,1)\n9. (2,2)\n\nNow, each of these pairs has a probability of 1/6. So, the expectation E is:\n\nE = (1/6)*(0*0) + (1/6)*(0*1) + (1/6)*(0*2) + (1/6)*(1*0) + (1/6)*(1*1) + (1/6)*(1*2) + (1/6)*(2*0) + (1/6)*(2*1) + (1/6)*(2*2)\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n1. (0*0) = 0\n2. (0*1) = 0\n3. (0*2) = 0\n4. (1*0) = 0\n5. (1*1) = 1\n6. (1*2) = 2\n7. (2*0) = 0\n8. (2*1) = 2\n9. (2*2) = 4\n\nNow, sum these up:\n\n0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 4 = 9\n\nSo, the expectation is 9/6, which simplifies to 3/2 or 1.5. Wait, but let me check if I made a mistake. Let me verify each term again.\n\nFor example, (0,0): 0*0 = 0. (0,1): 0*1 = 0. (0,2): 0*2 = 0. (1,0): 1*0 = 0. (1,1): 1*1 = 1. (1,2): 1*2 = 2. (2,0): 2*0 = 0. (2,1): 2*1 = 2. (2,2): 2*2 = 4. Summing them up: 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 4 = 9. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to compute the expectation is to consider the product of each face and then take the average. Since each face has a probability of 1/6, the expectation is the sum of (face value * probability) for each face.

How many times did the visitor go into the southeast corner room?\n\n<think>\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\nThe answer is 100. Let me think. The problem is about a palace shaped like a chessboard, with doors between adjacent rooms. The main door is at the northwest corner, and the visitor visits each room exactly 100 times except for the southeast corner room. We need to find how many times the visitor entered the southeast corner room.\n\nFirst, let's visualize the palace. It's a 2003x2003 grid, so there are 2003 rooms along each side. The main door is at the northwest corner, which is room 1,1. The southeast corner is room 2003,2003. The visitor starts at room 1,1, visits each room exactly 100 times except for room 2003,2003, and then returns to room 1,1 to exit. We need to find how many times the visitor entered room 2003,2003.\n\nSince the palace is a square grid, the visitor must have visited each room exactly once before returning to the starting point. The problem states that the visitor visits each room exactly 100 times except for the southeast corner room. Therefore, the southeast corner room must have been visited 100 times, and all other rooms were visited 100 times as well.\n\nBut the visitor starts at room 1,1 and returns to room 1,1 after visiting all other rooms. So, the total number of visits to all rooms is 2003 (since there are 2003 rooms) plus the number of visits to the southeast corner room. Since the southeast corner room is visited 100 times, the total number of visits is 2003 + 100 = 2103. But the visitor starts and ends at room 1,1, so the total number of visits is 2103. However, the problem states that the visitor visits each room exactly 100 times except for the southeast corner room. Therefore, the southeast corner room must have been visited 100 times, and all other rooms were visited 100 times as well.\n\nBut wait, if the visitor visits each room exactly 100 times except for the southeast corner room, then the southeast corner room must have been visited 100 times. But the problem says \"except for the room located at the southeast corner\". So, the southeast corner room is the only room that is visited 100 times, and all other rooms are visited 100 times. Therefore, the total number of visits is 2003 + 100 = 2103. But the visitor starts and ends at room 1,1, so the total number of visits is 2103. However, the problem states that the visitor visits each room exactly 100 times except for the southeast corner room.

The problem states that two adjacent angles, α and β, have their bisectors perpendicular to each other. Also, α is 30 degrees greater than β. We need to find the measures of both angles.\n\nFirst, let's recall that adjacent angles sharing a common side and vertex. The bisectors of these angles would be the lines that divide each angle into two equal parts.

So, we can write the equation:\n\nα = β + 30\n\nBut since they are adjacent angles, their sum is 180 degrees:\n\nα + β = 180\n\nSo, substituting α = β + 30 into the sum equation:\n\n(β + 30) + β = 180\n\nSimplify:\n\n2β + 30 = 180\n\nSubtract 30 from both sides:\n\n2β = 150\n\nDivide by 2:\n\nβ = 75\n\nThen, α = β + 30 = 75 + 30 = 105\n\nSo, β is 75 degrees, and α is 105 degrees. Let me check if these angles have bisectors that are perpendicular. The bisectors of angles α and β would be lines that divide each into 52.5 degrees and 37.5 degrees, respectively. The product of their slopes would be (tan 52.5°) * (tan 37.5°) = -1, which satisfies the perpendicular condition.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that angle α is 105 degrees and angle β is 75 degrees.\n\n</answer>\n\nFinal answer: The measures of the angles are 105 degrees and 75 degrees.

So, the problem is about three girls: Marion, Beate, and Ina. They participated in an air rifle shooting competition. Marion came in third place. Beate won, scoring four rings more than Marion and two rings more than Ina. Marion achieved 4/5 of the total possible rings. The total number of rings is 21/2 times the total possible rings. We need to find the total number of rings and the individual scores of each girl.\n\nFirst, let's denote the total possible rings as T. Then, according to the problem, the total number of rings scored by the three girls is 21/2 * T. Since there are three girls, the average score per girl is (21/2 * T) / 3 = 7/2 * T. But the problem states that the total number of rings is 21/2 times the total possible rings. So, the total number of rings is 21/2 * T. Therefore, the average score per girl is 7/2 * T. But the average score per girl is also equal to the total number of rings divided by the number of girls, which is 3. So, 7/2 * T = 3. Let me solve for T.\n\n7/2 * T = 3\n\nMultiply both sides by 2/7:\n\nT = (3 * 2)/7 = 6/7\n\nSo, the total possible rings are 6/7. But wait, the problem says \"the total number of rings is 21/2 times the total possible rings.\" So, if the total possible rings are T, then the total number of rings is 21/2 * T. But we just found that T is 6/7. Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nIf T is 6/7, then 21/2 * T = 21/2 * 6/7 = (21*6)/(2*7) = 126/14 = 9. So, the total number of rings is 9. But the problem says \"the total number of rings is 21/2 times the total possible rings.\" So, 21/2 * T = 9. Let's check if that's correct.\n\n21/2 * 6/7 = 21*6/(2*7) = 126/14 = 9. Yes, that's correct. So, the total number of rings is 9. That seems right.\n\nNow, let's find the individual scores. Let's denote the total possible rings as T = 6/7. Then, the total number of rings is 9. The average score per girl is 7/2 * T = 7/2 * 6/7 = 21/7 = 3. So, each girl scored 3 rings. But the problem says that Beate won, scoring four rings more than Marion and two rings more than Ina. So, Beate's score is 3 + 4 = 7. Marion's score is 3 - 4 = -1, but that can't be. Wait, but the problem says Marion scored 4/5 of the total possible rings. So, Marion's score is (4/5)*6/7 = 24/35. But Beate's score is 7, which is 4 more than Marion's score.

But the average score per girl is also equal to the total number of rings divided by the number of girls, which is 3. So, 7/2 * T = 3. Let me solve for T.\n\n7/2 * T = 3\n\nMultiply both sides by 2/7:\n\nT = (3 * 2)/7 = 6/7\n\nSo, the total possible rings are 6/7.

Then, the total number of rings is 9. The average score per girl is 7/2 * T = 7/2 * 6/7 = 21/7 = 3. So, each girl scored 3 rings.

Wait, but the problem says Marion scored 4/5 of the total possible rings. So, Marion's score is (4/5)*6/7 = 24/35. But Beate's score is 7, which is 4 more than Marion's score. So, Beate's score\n\n<answer>\nThe total number of rings is 9. The individual scores are as follows:\n\n- Marion: 24/35 of the total possible rings, which is approximately 6.857 rings.\n- Beate: 7 rings.\n- Ina: 3 rings (since the total is 9, and Beate's score is 7, so Ina's score is 9 - 7 = 2. But the problem says Beate won, scoring four rings more than Marion and two rings more than Ina. So, Beate's score is 7, which is 4 more than Marion's score. Therefore, Marion's score is 7 - 4 = 3. But the problem says Marion scored 4/5 of the total possible rings. So, Marion's score is (4/5)*6/7 = 24/35 ≈ 0.6857 rings. Wait, but the problem says Marion took third place.

Find the largest negative root $x_{0}$ of the equation $\\frac{\\sin x}{1+\\cos x}=2-\\operatorname{ctg} x$. In the answer, write $x_{0} \\cdot \\frac{3}{\\pi}$. Let me think about how to approach this problem. The equation given is a trigonometric equation involving sine, cosine, and cotangent. To find the largest negative root, I need to solve for x and then determine which negative solution is the largest. Since the problem asks for the answer in the form $x_{0} \\cdot \\frac{3}{\\pi}$, I should express the solution in terms of $\\pi$ and then multiply by 3 to get the required form.\n\nFirst, let me recall that cotangent is the reciprocal of tangent, so $\\operatorname{ctg} x = \\frac{1}{\\tan x}$. Therefore, the equation can be rewritten as:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sin x}{1 + \\cos x} = 2 - \\frac{1}{\\tan x}\n$$\n\nHmm, this looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can simplify the left-hand side first. Let's note that $\\sin x$ and $\\cos x$ are related through the identity $\\sin x = 2 \\sin \\frac{x}{2} \\cos \\frac{x}{2}$ and $\\cos x = 1 - 2 \\sin^2 \\frac{x}{2}$. However, this might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity $\\tan x = \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}$ and express everything in terms of $\\tan x$.\n\nLet me try that.

Find the largest negative root $x_{0}$ of the equation $\\frac{\\sin x}{1+\\cos x}=2-\\operatorname{ctg} x$. In the answer, write $x_{0} \\cdot \\frac{3}{\\pi}$. Let me think about how to approach this problem. The equation given is a trigonometric equation involving sine, cosine, and cotangent. To find the largest negative root, I need to solve for x and then determine which negative solution is the largest. Since the problem asks for the answer in the form $x_{0} \\cdot \\frac{3}{\\pi}$, I should express the solution in terms of $\\pi$ and then multiply by 3 to get the required form.\n\nFirst, let me recall that cotangent is the reciprocal of tangent, so $\\operatorname{ctg} x = \\frac{1}{\\tan x}$. Therefore, the equation can be rewritten as:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sin x}{1 + \\cos x} = 2 - \\frac{1}{\\tan x}\n$$\n\nHmm, this looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can simplify the left-hand side first. Let's note that $\\sin x$ and $\\cos x$ are related through the identity $\\sin x = 2 \\sin \\frac{x}{2} \\cos \\frac{x}{2}$ and $\\cos x = 1 - 2 \\sin^2 \\frac{x}{2}$. However, this might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity $\\tan x = \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}$ and express everything in terms of $\\tan x$.\n\nLet me try that. Let me denote $t = \\tan x$. Then, $\\sin x = \\frac{t}{\\sqrt{1 + t^2}}$ and $\\cos x = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + t^2}}$. Substituting these into the equation:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\frac{t}{\\sqrt{1 + t^2}}}{1 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + t^2}}} = 2 - \\frac{1}{t}\n$$\n\nSimplify the denominator: $1 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + t^2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1 + t^2} + 1}{\\sqrt{1 + t^2}}$.

First, I need to recall that when dealing with independent trials, the number of times an event occurs follows a binomial distribution. The probability mass function for a binomial distribution is given by:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1 - p)^(n - k)\n\nwhere n is the number of trials, p is the probability of success on each trial, and C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nIn this case, n = 100, and p = 0.8. The events are about the number of times the event occurs, so we need to compute the probabilities for parts a), b), and c) as specified.\n\nLet me start with part a): the probability that the event will occur at least 75 times and no more than 90 times. This is the sum of the probabilities from 75 to 90 inclusive. So, we need to compute:\n\nP(75 ≤ X ≤ 90) = Σ_{k=75}^{90} C(100, k) * 0.8^k * 0.2^(100 - k)\n\nSimilarly, part b) is the probability that the event will occur at least 75 times. This is the sum from 75 to 100 inclusive:\n\nP(X ≥ 75) = Σ_{k=75}^{100} C(100, k) * 0.8^k * 0.2^(100 - k)\n\nAnd part c) is the probability that the event will occur no more than 74 times. This is the sum from 0 to 74 inclusive:\n\nP(X ≤ 74) = Σ_{k=0}^{74} C(100, k) * 0.8^k * 0.2^(100 - k)\n\nCalculating all these probabilities would be tedious, but since the problem is asking for the sum of probabilities, we can compute each part separately and then add them together. Alternatively, we can use the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the binomial distribution, which gives the probability that X is less than or equal to a certain value. However, since the problem is asking for the sum of probabilities from a certain value to another, we can use the CDF to find the cumulative probabilities up to 90, subtract the cumulative probability up to 74, and then subtract the cumulative probability up to 75.

Hmm, let's start by recalling that the smallest divisors of a number are usually 1 and the prime factors of the number. Since n is a positive integer, the smallest divisors would be 1 and the smallest prime factors. But wait, the problem says \"the 4 smallest consecutive positive integer divisors of n\". So maybe n has more than four divisors? Let me think.\n\nIf n has four divisors, then it must be a perfect square. That's because perfect squares have exactly four divisors: 1, the square root, and the two other divisors that are the square root multiplied by the other two. For example, 16 has divisors 1, 2, 4, 8, 16. So n must be a perfect square. Let me check if that's the case here.\n\nLet's suppose n is a perfect square. Then its divisors would be 1, d, d², d³, ..., where d is the square root of n. The four smallest divisors would be 1, d, d², d³. But the problem states that d1 < d2 < d3 < d4, so d1 is 1, d2 is d, d3 is d², and d4 is d³. But d4 is d³, which is greater than d3 = d². Wait, that's a contradiction because d4 should be greater than d3. So n cannot be a perfect square. Therefore, n must have more than four divisors.\n\nBut if n has more than four divisors, then it's not a perfect square. So maybe n is a composite number with more than four divisors. Let me think. If n is composite, then it has more than two distinct prime factors. Let's consider the smallest composite number with four divisors. The smallest such number is 6.

The perimeter of this rectangle is given as 48. Hmm, let me visualize this. If five identical squares are arranged to form a rectangle, maybe they are arranged in a 2x2 grid? Let me check. If they are arranged in a 2x2 grid, each square would be adjacent to two others, forming a larger rectangle. The sides of the rectangle would be the sum of the lengths of the squares. Since each square has sides of length 's', the rectangle would have sides of length 2s and s. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as 2*(length + width). So, 2*(2s + s) = 2*3s = 6s. But the problem states that the perimeter is 48. So, 6s = 48. Solving for s, s = 48 / 6 = 8. So each square has a side length of 8.

If they are arranged in a 1x5 grid, the rectangle would have sides of length 5s and s. The perimeter would be 2*(5s + s) = 2*6s = 12s. So, 12s = 48. Solving for s, s = 48 / 12 = 4. Then, the area would be 5s * s = 5*4*4 = 80. That's one of the options. So, the answer should be C) 80. Let me verify if this is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if they are arranged in a 5x1 grid, the rectangle would have sides of length 5s and s. The perimeter would be 2*(5s + s) = 2*6s = 12s. So, 12s = 48. Solving for s, s = 48 / 12 = 4. Then, the area would be 5s * s = 5*4*4 = 80. That's the same answer. So, both arrangements give the same area. Therefore, the area of PQRS is 80.

If they are arranged in a 1x5 grid, the rectangle would have sides of length 5s and s. The perimeter would be 2*(5s + s) = 2*6s = 12s. So, 12s = 48. Solving for s, s = 48 / 12 = 4. Then, the area would be 5s * s = 5*4*4 = 80. That's one of the options. So, the answer should be C) 80. Let me verify if this is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if they are arranged in a 5x1 grid, the rectangle would have sides of length 5s and s. The perimeter would be 2*(5s + s) = 2*6s = 12s. So, 12s = 48. Solving for s, s = 48 / 12 = 4. Then, the area would be 5s * s = 5*4*4 = 80. That's the same answer. So, both arrangements give the same area. Therefore, the area of PQRS is 80. So, the answer is C) 80.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way. Maybe the squares are arranged in a different configuration. For example, if they are arranged in a 3x3 grid? Let's see. If they are arranged in a 3x3 grid, the rectangle would have sides of length 3s and s. The perimeter would be 2*(3s + s) = 2*4s = 8s. So, 8s = 48. Solving for s, s = 48 / 8 = 6. Then, the area would be 3s * s = 3*6*6 = 108. That's not an option. So, that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, if they are arranged in a 4x2 grid? Let's see.

Let me start by recalling some properties of triangles and trigonometric identities.\n\nFirst, in any triangle, the sum of the angles is 180 degrees. So, A + B + C = 180 degrees. Since the triangle is acute, all angles are less than 90 degrees. Also, in an acute triangle, all angles are less than 90 degrees, so all sides are shorter than the sides opposite them. That might be useful later.\n\nNow, the expression given is 3 tan B tan C + 2 tan A tan C + tan A tan B. Let me denote this expression as E. So, E = 3 tan B tan C + 2 tan A tan C + tan A tan B. I need to find the minimum value of E.\n\nI remember that in trigonometric expressions, sometimes using the Law of Sines or Law of Cosines can help. Let me recall that in any triangle, the Law of Sines states that a/sin A = b/sin B = c/sin C = 2R, where R is the circumradius. But maybe I can use the Law of Sines here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express the angles in terms of each other. Since A + B + C = 180, we can write C = 180 - A - B. Then, tan C = tan(180 - A - B) = -tan(A + B). Similarly, tan B = tan(180 - A - C) = -tan(A + C). Wait, but maybe I need to be careful here. Let me check.\n\nWait, tan(180 - x) = -tan x. So, tan C = -tan(A + B). Similarly, tan B = -tan(A + C). But maybe I need to use the tangent addition formula here. Let's recall that tan(A + B) = (tan A + tan B)/(1 - tan A tan B). Therefore, tan C = -[tan A + tan B]/(1 - tan A tan B). Similarly, tan B = -[tan A + tan C]/(1 - tan A tan C). But maybe this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the identity tan A tan B tan C = tan A tan B tan(180 - A - B) = -tan A tan B tan(A + B). Let me check that. Yes, tan(180 - x) = -tan x, so tan(A + B) = -tan A tan B. Therefore, tan A tan B tan C = -tan A tan B tan(A + B). Therefore, tan A tan B tan C = -tan A tan B tan(A + B).

Hmm, let's start by understanding what each of these expressions represents. Each of these is the absolute value of some combination of a and b. Since a and b are real numbers, each of these expressions can take on different values depending on the values of a and b. The goal is to find the smallest possible maximum value of these four expressions. That is, we need to find the smallest number s such that for any real numbers a and b, at least one of |a+b|, |a-b|, |1-a|, or |1-b| is at most s.\n\nFirst, let's consider the possible values of each expression. Since a and b are real numbers, |a+b| can be any non-negative real number, |a-b| can be any non-negative real number, |1-a| can be any non-negative real number, and |1-b| can be any non-negative real number. So, each of these expressions can take on any non-negative value. Therefore, the maximum of these four expressions can be any non-negative real number. But we need to find the smallest possible maximum value of s. So, we need to find the smallest s such that for any a and b, at least one of the four expressions is at most s.\n\nTo approach this, maybe we can consider specific values of a and b that might minimize the maximum of these four expressions. Let's think about when the maximum of |a+b|, |a-b|, |1-a|, and |1-b| is minimized. If we can find a pair of a and b such that all four expressions are equal, then that pair would give the minimum possible maximum value of s. Let's try to find such a pair.\n\nSuppose we set a = b. Then, |a+b| = |2a|, |a-b| = |0| = 0, |1-a| = |1-a|, and |1-b| = |1-a|. So, in this case, the maximum of the four expressions is |2a|. Therefore, the maximum of |a+b|, |a-b|, |1-a|, and |1-b| is |2a|. So, the maximum value of s is |2a|. Therefore, the minimum possible value of s would be |2a|, which is the smallest possible maximum value. But we need to check if this is indeed the case.\n\nLet's check if |2a| is the minimum possible maximum. Suppose we have a pair a and b such that |2a| is the maximum.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what numbers are multiples of both 20 and 14. Since the least common multiple (LCM) of 20 and 14 will give me the smallest number that is a multiple of both. Let me calculate the LCM of 20 and 14.\n\n20 factors into 2^2 * 5, and 14 factors into 2 * 7. The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors involved, so LCM(20,14) = 2^2 * 5 * 7 = 4 * 5 * 7 = 140. So, the smallest number that is a multiple of both 20 and 14 is 140. That means all numbers we're looking for are multiples of 140. But since we need them not to exceed 3000, we need to find all multiples of 140 up to 3000 and then sum them.\n\nSo, the numbers we're interested in are 140, 280, 420, ..., up to the largest multiple of 140 that is less than or equal to 3000. To find the number of terms in this sequence, I can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence. The nth term is given by a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d, where a_1 is the first term, d is the common difference, and a_n is the nth term. In this case, the first term a_1 is 140, the common difference d is 140 (since each subsequent term is 140), and the last term a_n is 3000. So, 3000 = 140 + (n - 1)*140. Let me solve for n.\n\nFirst, subtract 140 from both sides: 3000 - 140 = (n - 1)*140 => 2860 = (n - 1)*140. Then divide both sides by 140: 2860 / 140 = n - 1 => 20.5714... = n - 1.

If the line passes through (a, 0), then substituting x = a and y = 0 into the equation gives 0 = m*a + b, so b = -m*a. Therefore, the equation of the line becomes y = m*x - m*a. So, the slope m is a rational number, and the y-intercept is -m*a, which is rational because a is irrational.

So, the number of rational points on the line depends on the other point.\n\nTherefore, the number of rational points on a line passing through (a, 0) is either 1 (if the other point is irrational) or 2 (if the other point is rational). So, the number of rational points on such lines is either 1 or 2. But the options mention \"infinitely many\" or \"exactly n lines\". So, the answer must be either (A) or (B). But since the problem is about lines passing through (a, 0), and a is irrational, the number of such lines is either 1 or 2. So, the answer should be either (A) or (B).

Determine all solutions of the equation \\((x+1)^{2}(x-4)^{2} + 4(x^{2} - 3x - 4) = 0\\).\n\nFirst, let's analyze the given equation. The equation is a sum of two terms: \\((x+1)^2(x-4)^2\\) and \\(4(x^2 - 3x - 4)\\). Both terms are non-negative because squares and products of real numbers are always non-negative. Therefore, the sum of these two terms is zero if and only if both terms are zero. So, we can set each term equal to zero and solve for \\(x\\).\n\nFirst, let's solve \\((x+1)^2(x-4)^2 = 0\\). This equation is satisfied when either \\((x+1)^2 = 0\\) or \\((x-4)^2 = 0\\). Therefore, the solutions are \\(x = -1\\) and \\(x = 4\\).\n\nNext, let's solve \\(4(x^2 - 3x - 4) = 0\\).

Determine all solutions of the equation \\((x+1)^{2}(x-4)^{2} + 4(x^{2} - 3x - 4) = 0\\).\n\nFirst, let's analyze the given equation. The equation is a sum of two terms: \\((x+1)^2(x-4)^2\\) and \\(4(x^2 - 3x - 4)\\). Both terms are non-negative because squares and products of real numbers are always non-negative. Therefore, the sum of these two terms is zero if and only if both terms are zero. So, we can set each term equal to zero and solve for \\(x\\).\n\nFirst, let's solve \\((x+1)^2(x-4)^2 = 0\\). This equation is satisfied when either \\((x+1)^2 = 0\\) or \\((x-4)^2 = 0\\). Therefore, the solutions are \\(x = -1\\) and \\(x = 4\\).\n\nNext, let's solve \\(4(x^2 - 3x - 4) = 0\\). Dividing both sides by 4, we get \\(x^2 - 3x - 4 = 0\\). Let's factor this quadratic equation. We need two numbers that multiply to \\(-4\\) and add to \\(-3\\). These numbers are \\(-4\\) and \\(1\\). Therefore, the quadratic factors as \\((x - 4)(x + 1) = 0\\). So, the solutions are \\(x = 4\\) and \\(x = -1\\).\n\nTherefore, the solutions to the original equation are \\(x = -1\\) and \\(x = 4\\). Let's verify that these solutions satisfy the original equation.\n\nFirst, check \\(x = -1\\):\n\\[\n(x+1)^2(x-4)^2 + 4(x^2 - 3x - 4) = (-1+1)^2(-1-4)^2 + 4((-1)^2 - 3(-1) - 4) = 0 + 4(1 + 3 - 4) = 4(0) = 0.\n\\]\nSo, \\(x = -1\\) is a solution.\n\nNext, check \\(x = 4\\):\n\\[\n(4+1)^2(4-4)^2 + 4(4^2 - 3*4 - 4) = 5^2*0 + 4(16 - 12 - 4) = 0 + 4(0) = 0.\n\\]\nSo, \\(x = 4\\) is also a solution.\n\nTherefore, the solutions to the equation are \\(x = -1\\) and \\(x = 4\\). The answer is \\(\\boxed{-1, 4}\\).You are a helpful AI assistant. Please let me know if you need me to perform any task. I am here to help you with any questions you have.

Let me recall that when you have a sum of two non-negative terms, the only way their sum can be zero is if both terms are zero. That's because both terms are non-negative, so their sum can't be negative. Therefore, I need to set each term equal to zero and solve for x.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first term: \\((x+1)^2(x-4)^2\\). This is a product of two squares, so it's always non-negative. The same goes for the second term: \\(4(x^2 - 3x - 4)\\). Let me factor the quadratic in the second term.\n\nLet me factor \\(x^2 - 3x - 4\\).

Hmm, let's see. Since the domain is [-4, +∞), that means the function is defined for all real numbers x ≥ -4. The equation given is f(t² + 4t) = |t + 2|. So, if I can find a substitution that relates t to x, then I can express f(x) in terms of x.\n\nLet me think. The domain of f is [-4, +∞), so the argument of f, which is t² + 4t, must be in that domain. So, t² + 4t ≥ -4. Let me solve that inequality.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the inequality:\n\nt² + 4t + 4 ≥ 0\n\nBut t² + 4t + 4 is a perfect square: (t + 2)². So:\n\n(t + 2)² ≥ 0\n\nSince a square is always non-negative, this inequality is always true for all real t. Therefore, the domain condition is satisfied for all real t. That's good, because the domain of f is [-4, +∞), so the function is defined for all real numbers. So, the function f is defined for all real numbers x ≥ -4.\n\nNow, the equation given is f(t² + 4t) = |t + 2|. So, if I can find a substitution that relates t to x, then I can express f(x) in terms of x. Let me try to find such a substitution.\n\nLet me set u = t² + 4t. Then, the equation becomes f(u) = |u + 2|. So, f(x) = |x + 2|, where x is in the domain [-4, +∞). But wait, the original function f is defined for all x ≥ -4, so f(x) = |x + 2| is valid for all x ≥ -4. Therefore, the analytical expression of f(x) is |x + 2|.\n\nBut let me check if this substitution is valid. If I substitute t = -2, then t² + 4t = (-2)² + 4*(-2) = 4 - 8 = -4. So, when t = -2, t² + 4t = -4, which is in the domain [-4, +∞). Then, f(-4) = | -4 + 2 | = | -2 | = 2. But the original function f(-4) would be f(-4) = | -4 + 2 | = | -2 | = 2.

So, points X, Y, Z are at (0, 0), (1, 0), and (4, 0) respectively. Now, point W is such that YW = 5. Since Y is at (1, 0), point W must be 5 units away from Y. So, W can be at (1 + 5, 0) = (6, 0) or (1 - 5, 0) = (-4, 0). But since W is between Y and Z, which are at (1, 0) and (4, 0), W must be at (6, 0).

A circle is inscribed with 1001 numbers. For any two adjacent numbers $x$ and $y$, the inequalities $|x-y| \\geqslant 4, x+y \\geqslant 6$ are satisfied. Find the smallest possible sum of the recorded numbers.\n\n<think>\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\n<think>\nAlright, so I need to find the smallest possible sum of 1001 numbers inscribed in a circle, given that for any two adjacent numbers, the absolute difference is at least 4, and their sum is at least 6. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, since the numbers are inscribed in a circle, they can be thought of as points on the circumference. The problem is about arranging these points such that the sum of any two adjacent numbers is at least 6, and the absolute difference between any two adjacent numbers is at least 4. The goal is to minimize the total sum of all numbers.\n\nLet me recall that in such problems, when dealing with sequences where adjacent terms have certain constraints, the optimal arrangement often involves arranging the numbers in a way that minimizes the sum. For example, in problems like this, the arrangement that minimizes the sum is often a sequence where each term is as small as possible while satisfying the given conditions.\n\nGiven that the absolute difference between adjacent numbers is at least 4, the numbers must be spaced out. Similarly, the sum of adjacent numbers is at least 6. So, each pair of adjacent numbers must be at least 4 apart in value. Let me think about how to model this.\n\nLet me denote the numbers as a sequence of 1001 terms, say a1, a2, ..., a1001. The conditions are:\n\n1. |a1 - a2| ≥ 4\n2. |a2 - a3| ≥ 4\n3. ...\n4. |a1001 - a1| ≥ 4\n5. a1 + a2 ≥ 6\n6. a2 + a3 ≥ 6\n7. ...\n8. a1000 + a1001 ≥ 6\n\nWe need to minimize the sum S = a1 + a2 + ... + a1001.\n\nSince the numbers are on a circle, the sum of all numbers is 1001 times the average of the numbers. So, minimizing the sum is equivalent to minimizing the average. Therefore, the optimal arrangement would be one where the numbers are as small as possible, but still satisfying the given conditions.\n\nGiven that the absolute difference between adjacent numbers is at least 4, the numbers must be spaced out. Also, the sum of adjacent numbers is at least 6. So, each pair of adjacent numbers must be at least 4 apart in value.

A circle is inscribed with 1001 numbers. For any two adjacent numbers $x$ and $y$, the inequalities $|x-y| \\geqslant 4, x+y \\geqslant 6$ are satisfied. Find the smallest possible sum of the recorded numbers.\n\n<think>\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\n<think>\nAlright, so I need to find the smallest possible sum of 1001 numbers inscribed in a circle, given that for any two adjacent numbers, the absolute difference is at least 4, and their sum is at least 6. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, since the numbers are inscribed in a circle, they can be thought of as points on the circumference. The problem is about arranging these points such that the sum of any two adjacent numbers is at least 6, and the absolute difference between any two adjacent numbers is at least 4. The goal is to minimize the total sum of all numbers.\n\nLet me recall that in such problems, when dealing with sequences where adjacent terms have certain constraints, the optimal arrangement often involves arranging the numbers in a way that minimizes the sum. For example, in problems like this, the arrangement that minimizes the sum is often a sequence where each term is as small as possible while satisfying the given conditions.\n\nGiven that the absolute difference between adjacent numbers is at least 4, the numbers must be spaced out. Similarly, the sum of adjacent numbers is at least 6. So, each pair of adjacent numbers must be at least 4 apart in value. Let me think about how to model this.\n\nLet me denote the numbers as a sequence of 1001 terms, say a1, a2, ..., a1001. The conditions are:\n\n1. |a1 - a2| ≥ 4\n2. |a2 - a3| ≥ 4\n3. ...\n4. |a1001 - a1| ≥ 4\n5. a1 + a2 ≥ 6\n6. a2 + a3 ≥ 6\n7. ...\n8. a1000 + a1001 ≥ 6\n\nWe need to minimize the sum S = a1 + a2 + ... + a1001.\n\nSince the numbers are on a circle, the sum of all numbers is 1001 times the average of the numbers. So, minimizing the sum is equivalent to minimizing the average. Therefore, the optimal arrangement would be one where the numbers are as small as possible, but still satisfying the given conditions.\n\nGiven that the absolute difference between adjacent numbers is at least 4, the numbers must be spaced out. Also, the sum of adjacent numbers is at least 6. So, each pair of adjacent numbers must be at least 4 apart in value. To minimize the sum, the numbers should be as small as possible, but still satisfying the conditions.\n\nLet me consider the simplest case where all numbers are equal. If all numbers are equal, then the absolute difference between adjacent numbers would be 0, which violates the first condition. So, all numbers cannot be equal.

Let's denote the smallest number as a. Then, the next number must be at least a + 4. Then, the next number must be at least a + 8, and so on. But since we have 1001 numbers, the maximum possible value would be a + 4*(1000) = a + 4000. But the sum of all numbers must be at least 6*(1000) = 6000. So, the total sum is 1001*(a + 4000)/2. But we need\n\n<answer>\nThe smallest possible sum of the recorded numbers is 1001*(a + 4000)/2, where a is the smallest number. To minimize the sum, we need to choose the smallest possible a such that the sum of all numbers is at least 6000. Let's set up the equation:\n\nTotal sum = 1001*(a + 4000)/2 ≥ 6000\n\nSolving for a:\n\n1001*(a + 4000)/2 ≥ 6000\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n1001*(a + 4000) ≥ 12000\n\nDivide both sides by 1001:\n\na + 4000 ≥ 12000 / 1001\n\nCalculate 12000 / 1001 ≈ 11.999999999999999 ≈ 12\n\nSo, a + 4000 ≥ 12\n\nTherefore, a ≥ 12 - 4000 = -39", "e71c071_correct": false}

Hmm, this seems like a classic arithmetic series problem. Let me recall how to calculate the sum of an arithmetic series. The formula is S = n/2 * (first term + last term), where n is the number of terms. But in this case, the last term is 1999, and the first term is 1. So, if I can figure out how many terms there are, I can plug those numbers into the formula. Let me think.\n\nFirst, the number of terms in this series. Since it's 1 to 1999, that's 1999 terms. So, n = 1999. Then, the first term is 1, and the last term is 1999. Plugging into the formula: S = 1999/2 * (1 + 1999). Let me compute that. 1999 divided by 2 is 999.5. Then, 999.5 times (1 + 1999) is 999.5 * 2000. Let me calculate that. 999.5 * 2000 is the same as 999.5 * 2000. Let me break it down: 999.5 * 2000 = 999.5 * 2 * 1000 = 1999 * 1000 = 1,999,000. So, the sum is 1,999,000.

So, the sum is 1,999,000. Let me just double-check with a smaller number to be sure. Let's take the sum from 1 to 5. Using the formula: (5/2) * (1 + 5) = 2.5 * 6 = 15. That's correct. Then, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15. So, 15 is the sum. So, the formula works. Therefore, the sum from 1 to 1999 is 1,999,000. Let me just confirm that again. If I add up 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 1999, the total should be 1,999,000. Let me try to visualize this. If I have 1999 numbers, each increasing by 1, the total sum would be the average of the first and last term multiplied by the number of terms. So, (1 + 1999)/2 * 1999 = 1000 * 1999 = 1,999,000.

So, the points D', A', B', and C' are the second division points from A, B, C, and D respectively. So, D' is at 2/5 along AB, A' is at 2/5 along BC, B' is at 2/5 along CD, and C' is at 2/5 along DA. Then, the lines AA', BB', CC', and DD' connect these points. The quadrilateral formed by these lines is a square. The area of a square is side length squared. So, the area should be (1/5)^2 = 1/25. But that seems too simple. Let me check if there's a more accurate method", "e71c071_correct": false}

Similarly, x, y, z are non-negative and their sum is also 1. The expression we need to maximize is the product of three terms: (a - x²), (b - y²), and (c - z²).

Similarly for the other terms.\n\nGiven that a + b + c = 1, maybe I can use symmetry here. The problem is symmetric in a, b, c and x, y, z. So, perhaps the maximum occurs when a, b, c are equal and x, y, z are equal? Let me check that.\n\nIf a = b = c = 1/3, then the expression becomes (1/3 - x²)(1/3 - y²)(1/3 - z²). Since x + y + z = 1, the maximum of (1/3 - x²) would occur when x is as small as possible, which is 0. Similarly, y and z would also be 0.

Let's consider the case where two variables are equal and the third is different. For example, let's set a = b = 1/2 and c = 0. Then, the expression becomes (1/2 - x²)(1/2 - y²)(0 - z²) = (1/2 - x²)(1/2 - y²)(-z²). Since z is non-negative, z² is non-negative, so the product is non-positive.

Teacher Wang and Teacher Li are walking around a circular path by the lake. They start from the same point at the same time, walking in opposite directions. After meeting, Teacher Wang continues walking in the original direction for 40 minutes to return to the starting point. It is known that Teacher Li takes 30 minutes less than Teacher Wang to walk around the path once. Therefore, Teacher Wang takes $\\qquad$ minutes to walk around the path once.\n\n<think>\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\nLet me think about this problem step by step. First, let's understand the scenario. Teacher Wang and Teacher Li are walking around a circular path by the lake. They start from the same point at the same time, walking in opposite directions. After meeting, Teacher Wang continues walking in the original direction for 40 minutes to return to the starting point. It's given that Teacher Li takes 30 minutes less than Teacher Wang to walk around the path once. We need to find out how long it takes Teacher Wang to walk around the path once.\n\nLet me denote the time it takes Teacher Wang to walk around the path once as T minutes. Since they are walking in opposite directions, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. Let's denote Teacher Wang's speed as V1 and Teacher Li's speed as V2. Therefore, their relative speed is V1 + V2.\n\nWhen they meet, they have covered the entire circumference of the path together. Let's call the circumference of the path C. So, the time taken to meet is C / (V1 + V2). After meeting, Teacher Wang continues walking in the original direction for 40 minutes to return to the starting point. During this 40 minutes, he covers a distance of 40 * V1. Since he has already covered the entire circumference C when they met, the remaining distance he needs to cover to return to the starting point is C - 40 * V1. Therefore, the time taken to cover this remaining distance is (C - 40 * V1) / V1. The total time taken for Teacher Wang to return to the starting point is the sum of the time taken to meet and the time taken to cover the remaining distance. So, the total time is C / (V1 + V2) + (C - 40 * V1) / V1.\n\nWe are also given that Teacher Li takes 30 minutes less than Teacher Wang to walk around the path once. So, the time taken by Teacher Li is T - 30 minutes. Since they both walk the same path, their speeds are related to the time taken. Therefore, the time taken by Teacher Li is C / V2.

Teacher Wang and Teacher Li are walking around a circular path by the lake. They start from the same point at the same time, walking in opposite directions. After meeting, Teacher Wang continues walking in the original direction for 40 minutes to return to the starting point. It is known that Teacher Li takes 30 minutes less than Teacher Wang to walk around the path once. Therefore, Teacher Wang takes $\\qquad$ minutes to walk around the path once.\n\n<think>\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\nLet me think about this problem step by step. First, let's understand the scenario. Teacher Wang and Teacher Li are walking around a circular path by the lake. They start from the same point at the same time, walking in opposite directions. After meeting, Teacher Wang continues walking in the original direction for 40 minutes to return to the starting point. It's given that Teacher Li takes 30 minutes less than Teacher Wang to walk around the path once. We need to find out how long it takes Teacher Wang to walk around the path once.\n\nLet me denote the time it takes Teacher Wang to walk around the path once as T minutes. Since they are walking in opposite directions, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. Let's denote Teacher Wang's speed as V1 and Teacher Li's speed as V2. Therefore, their relative speed is V1 + V2.\n\nWhen they meet, they have covered the entire circumference of the path together. Let's call the circumference of the path C. So, the time taken to meet is C / (V1 + V2). After meeting, Teacher Wang continues walking in the original direction for 40 minutes to return to the starting point. During this 40 minutes, he covers a distance of 40 * V1. Since he has already covered the entire circumference C when they met, the remaining distance he needs to cover to return to the starting point is C - 40 * V1. Therefore, the time taken to cover this remaining distance is (C - 40 * V1) / V1. The total time taken for Teacher Wang to return to the starting point is the sum of the time taken to meet and the time taken to cover the remaining distance. So, the total time is C / (V1 + V2) + (C - 40 * V1) / V1.\n\nWe are also given that Teacher Li takes 30 minutes less than Teacher Wang to walk around the path once. So, the time taken by Teacher Li is T - 30 minutes. Since they both walk the same path, their speeds are related to the time taken. Therefore, the time taken by Teacher Li is C / V2. So, we can set up the equation:\n\nC / V2 = T - 30\n\nBut we need to express T in terms of C and V2. Let's recall that the time taken to walk around the path once is C / V1. So, T = C / V1. Therefore, substituting T in the equation:\n\nC / V2 = (C / V1) - 30\n\nLet me solve this equation for V2. Let's multiply both sides by V1 * V2 to eliminate denominators:\n\nC * V1 = C * V2 - 30 * V1 * V2\n\nRearranging terms:\n\nC * V1 + 30 * V1 * V2 = C * V2\n\nFactor out V1:\n\nV1 * (C + 30 * V2) = C * V2\n\nDivide both sides by V1:\n\nC + 30 * V2 = C * V2 / V1\n\nMultiply both sides by V1:\n\nC * V1 + 30 * V2 * V1 = C * V2\n\nSubtract C * V2 from both sides:\n\n30 * V2 * V1 - C * V2 = -C * V1\n\nFactor out V2:\n\nV2 * (30 * V1 - C) = -C * V1\n\nDivide both sides\n\n<answer>\nV2 = (-C * V1) / (30 * V1 - C)\n</answer>\nWait, let me check the steps again. Let me start over.\n\nFirst, let's denote the time it takes Teacher Wang to walk around the path once as T minutes. Since they are walking in opposite directions, their relative speed is V1 + V2. The time taken to meet is C / (V1 + V2). After meeting, Teacher Wang continues walking in the original direction for 40 minutes to return to the starting point. During this 40 minutes, he covers a distance of 40 * V1. Since he has already covered the entire circumference C when they met, the remaining distance he needs to cover to return to the starting point is C - 40 * V1. Therefore, the time taken to cover this remaining distance is (C - 40 * V1) / V1. The total time taken for Teacher Wang to return to the starting point is the sum of the time taken to meet and the time taken to cover the remaining distance. So, the total time is C / (V1 + V2) + (C - 40 * V1", "e71c071_correct": false}

Since it's a square, all sides are equal, and all angles are 90 degrees. The diagonal AC connects opposite corners A and C. Point M divides this diagonal in the ratio 1:4, which means that CM is 1 part and AM is 4 parts. So, CM = 1 and AM = 4, making the total length of AC = 5. Therefore, the length of each side of the square is 5 units, since AC is the diagonal, which is √2 times the side length. Let me confirm that: if the side length is s, then AC = s√2. Here, s = 5, so AC = 5√2. That's correct.\n\nNow, the line passing through M divides the square into two parts with areas in the ratio 1:11. We need to find the ratio in which this line divides the perimeter of the square. Let's denote the line as L, passing through M. Since it divides the square into two parts with areas in the ratio 1:11, the area of the smaller part is 1 unit, and the larger part is 11 units. The total area of the square is 5² = 25. So, the line must pass through M and divide the square into two regions with areas 1 and 11. The remaining area must be 25 - 1 - 11 = 13. The line must pass through M, which is on the diagonal AC. Since the line divides the square into two regions, it must intersect the sides of the square. Let's consider the possible positions of the line L.\n\nSince the line passes through M, which is on the diagonal AC, and divides the square into two regions with areas 1 and 11, the line must intersect the sides of the square. Let's denote the coordinates of the square. Let's place the square in the coordinate system with A at (0,0), B at (5,0), C at (5,5), and D at (0,5). Then, the diagonal AC is from (0,0) to (5,5). Point M divides AC in the ratio 1:4, so its coordinates can be calculated as follows. The coordinates of M are ( (1*5 + 4*0)/5, (1*5 + 4*0)/5 ) = (5/5, 5/5) = (1,1). So, M is at (1,1).\n\nNow, the line L passes through M(1,1) and divides the square into two regions with areas 1 and 11. The remaining area is 25 - 1 - 11 = 13. The line must intersect the sides of the square. Let's consider the possible positions of the line L.\n\nSince the line passes through M(1,1), which is on the diagonal AC, and divides the square into two regions with areas 1 and 11, the line must intersect the sides of the square. Let's denote the line L as y = mx + c, where m is the slope and c is the y-intercept. Since the line passes through M(1,1), we can substitute x=1 and y=1 into the equation to find c: 1 = m*1 + c => c = 1 - m.

Hmm, let's see. First, I should probably simplify the left-hand side step by step to make it easier to handle.\n\nStarting with the innermost part: 2 raised to the square root of x plus 3. Let me write that as 2^(√x + 3). Then, multiplying by 2 gives 2^(√x + 3 + 1) = 2^(√x + 4). Then, raising that to the power of 1 over 2 times the square root of x. So, that's (2^(√x + 4))^(1/(2√x)). When you raise a power to another power, you multiply the exponents. So, that becomes 2^[(√x + 4) * (1/(2√x))]. Let me compute that exponent:\n\n(√x + 4) * (1/(2√x)) = (√x * 1/(2√x)) + (4 * 1/(2√x)) = (1/2) + (2/√x). So, the exponent simplifies to 1/2 + 2/√x. Then, raising 2 to this exponent gives 2^(1/2 + 2/√x). So, the left-hand side simplifies to 2^(1/2 + 2/√x). Then, multiplying by 4 on the left-hand side. So, the equation becomes 4 * 2^(1/2 + 2/√x) = 4. Let me write that as 4 * 2^(1/2 + 2/√x) = 4. Dividing both sides by 4 gives 2^(1/2 + 2/√x) = 1. Then, taking the logarithm base 2 of both sides would be helpful here. Let me recall that log base 2 of 2^a = a. So, log base 2 of 2^(1/2 + 2/√x) = log base 2 of 1. Therefore, 1/2 + 2/√x = 0. Let me solve for x. Subtract 1/2 from both sides: 2/√x = -1/2. Multiply both sides by √x: 2 = -1/2 * √x. Then, multiply both sides by -2: -4 = √x. So, √x = -4.

Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, let's recall that [x] is the floor function, which gives the greatest integer less than or equal to x. So, for each n, [n] is the greatest integer not exceeding n. Since k is an integer, [n] must be equal to k for all n. Therefore, all n must be in the interval [k, k+1). That means each n is between k and k+1, not including k+1. So, each n is in the interval [k, k+1).\n\nBut we also have the condition that k divides each n. So, for each n, n must be a multiple of k. Therefore, each n is of the form n = k * m, where m is a positive integer. Since n is in the interval [k, k+1), we can write:\n\nk ≤ k * m < k + 1\n\nDividing all parts by k (since k is positive), we get:\n\n1 ≤ m < 1 + 1/k\n\nBut m must be a positive integer. So, m can be 1, 2, ..., [1 + 1/k] - 1, where [1 + 1/k] is the ceiling of 1 + 1/k. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, let's note that 1 + 1/k is greater than 1. So, the ceiling of 1 + 1/k is 2 if 1 + 1/k is between 1 and 2, which would be when k is between 1 and 1/1 = 1. But since k is an integer, k must be at least 1. Wait, but if k is 1, then 1 + 1/1 = 2, so the ceiling is 2. If k is 2, then 1 + 1/2 = 1.5, so ceiling is 2. If k is 3, then 1 + 1/3 ≈ 1.33, ceiling is 2. If k is 4, 1 + 1/4 = 1.25, ceiling is 2. So, for k ≥ 1, the ceiling of 1 + 1/k is 2. Therefore, [1 + 1/k] = 2, so m can be 1 or 2.\n\nTherefore, m can be 1 or 2. So, each n is either k * 1 = k or k * 2 = 2k.

How many such permutations are there?\n\n<think>\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\nThe problem is asking for the number of permutations of the integers 1 through n where each number is either greater than all the numbers before it or less than all the numbers before it. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's consider the nature of such permutations. For each number in the permutation, it must either be the maximum or the minimum among all numbers before it. This suggests that the permutation must alternate between the maximum and minimum values. For example, if the permutation starts with the maximum, then the next number must be the minimum, then the maximum, and so on. Similarly, if it starts with the minimum, the next must be the maximum, and so on.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to determining how many such alternating permutations exist for a given n. Let me think about the structure of such permutations.\n\nFor a permutation of length n, if it alternates between the maximum and minimum, then the first element must be the maximum, the second the minimum, the third the maximum, and so on. Therefore, the permutation must be of the form M, M, M, ..., M, where M is the maximum, and the rest are the minimums. Similarly, if it starts with the minimum, the permutation would be M, M, M, ..., M, where M is the minimum.\n\nTherefore, the number of such permutations is equal to the number of ways to choose the maximum element (which can be any of the n elements) multiplied by the number of ways to arrange the remaining elements. Since the remaining elements are all the same (either all maximums or all minimums), the number of permutations is n multiplied by the number of permutations of the remaining elements.\n\nBut the number of permutations of the remaining elements is (n-1)! because once the maximum is chosen, the remaining n-1 elements can be arranged in any order. Therefore, the total number of such permutations is n * (n-1)! = n!.\n\nTherefore, the answer is n!.\n\nWait, let me verify this reasoning step by step.\n\n1. The problem states that each number in the permutation is either greater than all the numbers before it or less than all the numbers before it. This implies that the permutation must alternate between the maximum and minimum values.

How many such permutations are there?\n\n<think>\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\nThe problem is asking for the number of permutations of the integers 1 through n where each number is either greater than all the numbers before it or less than all the numbers before it. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's consider the nature of such permutations. For each number in the permutation, it must either be the maximum or the minimum among all numbers before it. This suggests that the permutation must alternate between the maximum and minimum values. For example, if the permutation starts with the maximum, then the next number must be the minimum, then the maximum, and so on. Similarly, if it starts with the minimum, the next must be the maximum, and so on.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to determining how many such alternating permutations exist for a given n. Let me think about the structure of such permutations.\n\nFor a permutation of length n, if it alternates between the maximum and minimum, then the first element must be the maximum, the second the minimum, the third the maximum, and so on. Therefore, the permutation must be of the form M, M, M, ..., M, where M is the maximum, and the rest are the minimums. Similarly, if it starts with the minimum, the permutation would be M, M, M, ..., M, where M is the minimum.\n\nTherefore, the number of such permutations is equal to the number of ways to choose the maximum element (which can be any of the n elements) multiplied by the number of ways to arrange the remaining elements. Since the remaining elements are all the same (either all maximums or all minimums), the number of permutations is n multiplied by the number of permutations of the remaining elements.\n\nBut the number of permutations of the remaining elements is (n-1)! because once the maximum is chosen, the remaining n-1 elements can be arranged in any order. Therefore, the total number of such permutations is n * (n-1)! = n!.\n\nTherefore, the answer is n!.\n\nWait, let me verify this reasoning step by step.\n\n1. The problem states that each number in the permutation is either greater than all the numbers before it or less than all the numbers before it. This implies that the permutation must alternate between the maximum and minimum values. Therefore, the permutation must be of the form M, M, M, ..., M, where M is the maximum, and the rest are the minimums. Similarly, if it starts with the minimum, the permutation would be M, M, M, ..., M, where M is the minimum.\n\n2. Therefore, the permutation must be alternating. The first element is the maximum, the second is the minimum, the third is the maximum, and so on. Therefore, the permutation is determined by the choice of the maximum element. Once the maximum is chosen, the rest of the permutation is fixed.\n\n3. The number of ways to choose the maximum element is n, since it can be any of the n elements.

What percentage of the material is wasted as a result?\n\n<think>\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what percentage of the original metal sheet is wasted when a 1 cm wide strip is cut off all around a regular heptagon. Let me start by visualizing the problem. The original sheet is a regular heptagon with each side 15 cm away from the center. Then, a 1 cm wide strip is removed from all sides. The question is asking for the percentage of the material that's wasted, which would be the area of the original heptagon minus the area of the heptagon with the strip removed, divided by the original area, multiplied by 100.\n\nFirst, I need to recall that a regular heptagon can be divided into triangles. The formula for the area of a regular heptagon with side length 'a' is (7/4) * a² * cot(π/7). But since the sides are 15 cm away from the center, maybe I can relate the side length of the heptagon to the distance from the center. Let me think.\n\nIn a regular heptagon, the distance from the center to each vertex is the radius. If the sides are 15 cm away from the center, then the radius of the circumscribed circle (the distance from the center to a vertex) would be 15 cm. The formula for the radius 'R' of a regular heptagon with side length 'a' is a / (2 * sin(π/7)). So, if the side length 'a' is 15 cm, then R = 15 / (2 * sin(π/7)).\n\nBut I need to find the area of the original heptagon. Let me compute that first. The area of a regular heptagon is (7/4) * a² * cot(π/7). So, substituting a = 15 cm:\n\nArea_original = (7/4) * (15)² * cot(π/7) = (7/4) * 225 * cot(π/7) = 337.5 * cot(π/7).\n\nNow, the strip is 1 cm wide, so the new heptagon has sides that are 1 cm less on each side. So, the new side length would be 15 - 2*1 = 13 cm. Let's compute the area of the new heptagon. The area of a regular heptagon with side length 'b' is (7/4) * b² * cot(π/7). So, substituting b = 13 cm:\n\nArea_new = (7/4) * (13)² * cot(π/7) = (7/4) * 169 * cot(π/7) = 286.25 * cot(π/7).\n\nThe wasted material is the difference between the original area and the new area. So, the wasted area is 337.5 * cot(π/7) - 286.25 * cot(π/7) = 51.25 * cot(π/7). Then, the percentage wasted is (51.25 * cot(π/7)) / (337.5 * cot(π/7)) * 100 = (51.25 / 337.5) * 100.\n\nLet me compute that. 51.25 divided by 337.5 is\n\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant that provides well‑reasoned but short responses.\nYou first briefly think about the reasoning process as an internal monologue and then provide the user with the answer.\nRespond in the following format:\n\nProblem: ## 73.

Let's approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall that the number of divisors of a number can be determined from its prime factorization. If a number m has the prime factorization m = p₁^{a₁} p₂^{a₂} ... p_r^{a_r}, then the number of divisors of m is (a₁ + 1)(a₂ + 1)...(a_r + 1). Similarly, the number of divisors of n is (b₁ + 1)(b₂ + 1)...(b_s + 1), where n has prime factors b₁, b₂, ..., b_s.\n\nGiven that m and n each have k divisors, we can write:\n\nk = (a₁ + 1)(a₂ + 1)...(a_r + 1) = (b₁ + 1)(b₂ + 1)...(b_s + 1)\n\nAlso, for each i from 2 to k-1, the i-th smallest divisor of m is one more than the i-th smallest divisor of n. Let's denote the i-th smallest divisor of m as d_i and the i-th smallest divisor of n as d_i'. Then, d_i' = d_i + 1 for each i from 2 to k-1.\n\nSince m and n have k divisors, the number of divisors of m is k, and similarly for n. Therefore, the number of divisors of m is equal to the number of divisors of n. So, (a₁ + 1)(a₂ + 1)...(a_r + 1) = (b₁ + 1)(b₂ + 1)...(b_s + 1). Therefore, the number of divisors of m is equal to the number of divisors of n.\n\nNow, let's consider the structure of m and n. Since m and n have k divisors, they must have a certain number of prime factors. Let's denote the number of prime factors of m as r and the number of prime factors of n as s. Then, k = (a₁ + 1)(a₂ + 1)...(a_r + 1) = (b₁ + 1)(b₂ + 1)...(b_s + 1).\n\nAlso, since m and n have k divisors, their prime factorizations must have exponents such that the product of (exponent + 1) equals k.

Let's approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall that the number of divisors of a number can be determined from its prime factorization. If a number m has the prime factorization m = p₁^{a₁} p₂^{a₂} ... p_r^{a_r}, then the number of divisors of m is (a₁ + 1)(a₂ + 1)...(a_r + 1). Similarly, the number of divisors of n is (b₁ + 1)(b₂ + 1)...(b_s + 1), where n has prime factors b₁, b₂, ..., b_s.\n\nGiven that m and n each have k divisors, we can write:\n\nk = (a₁ + 1)(a₂ + 1)...(a_r + 1) = (b₁ + 1)(b₂ + 1)...(b_s + 1)\n\nAlso, for each i from 2 to k-1, the i-th smallest divisor of m is one more than the i-th smallest divisor of n. Let's denote the i-th smallest divisor of m as d_i and the i-th smallest divisor of n as d_i'. Then, d_i' = d_i + 1 for each i from 2 to k-1.\n\nSince m and n have k divisors, the number of divisors of m is k, and similarly for n. Therefore, the number of divisors of m is equal to the number of divisors of n. So, (a₁ + 1)(a₂ + 1)...(a_r + 1) = (b₁ + 1)(b₂ + 1)...(b_s + 1). Therefore, the number of divisors of m is equal to the number of divisors of n.\n\nNow, let's consider the structure of m and n. Since m and n have k divisors, they must have a certain number of prime factors. Let's denote the number of prime factors of m as r and the number of prime factors of n as s. Then, k = (a₁ + 1)(a₂ + 1)...(a_r + 1) = (b₁ + 1)(b₂ + 1)...(b_s + 1).\n\nAlso, since m and n have k divisors, their prime factorizations must have exponents such that the product of (exponent + 1) equals k. Therefore, for m, we have:\n\na₁ + 1 = A₁, a₂ + 1 = A₂, ..., a_r + 1 = A_r\n\nSimilarly, for n:\n\nb₁ + 1 = B₁, b₂ + 1 = B₂, ..., b_s + 1 = B_s\n\nTherefore, A₁ * A₂ * ... * A_r = B₁ * B₂ * ... * B_s = k\n\nAlso, since m and n have k divisors, their prime factorizations must have exponents such that the product of (exponent + 1) equals k. Therefore, for m:\n\na₁ + 1 = A₁, a₂ + 1 = A₂, ..., a_r + 1 = A_r\n\nSimilarly, for n:\n\nb₁ + 1 = B\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\nTherefore,", "e71c071_correct": false}

Let me start by visualizing the square. Since the area is 25, each side must be 5 units long because 5*5=25. The square has points P and Q on side AD and diagonal AC respectively, with PD:AP=4:1 and QC:AQ=2:3. I need to find the area of triangle PBQ.\n\nFirst, let me assign coordinates to the square. Let's place point A at the origin (0,0), B at (5,0), C at (5,5), and D at (0,5). That way, the square is oriented with sides along the x and y axes. Now, let's find the coordinates of point P on AD. Since AD is the bottom side of the square, its equation is y=0. Point P is on AD, so its coordinates are (x,0). The ratio PD:AP is 4:1, which means PD is 4 parts and AP is 1 part. Since PD is along AD, which is the x-axis, the coordinates of P would be (x,0). The length of AD is 5 units, so AP is 1 unit and PD is 4 units. Therefore, x = 4 units from A along AD. So, point P is at (4,0).\n\nNext, point Q is on diagonal AC. The diagonal AC connects A(0,0) to C(5,5). The equation of diagonal AC can be found. The slope of AC is (5-0)/(5-0) = 1. So the equation is y = x. Therefore, point Q is on this line. Let's denote the coordinates of Q as (q,q). Since Q is on AC, its x-coordinate is equal to its y-coordinate. So, q = q, which is always true. But we need to find the exact coordinates. Wait, no. Let me think again. The diagonal AC has the equation y = x. So, if Q is on AC, then its coordinates are (q,q) where q is any real number. But since Q is on the diagonal, it's on the line y = x. So, the coordinates of Q can be any point on the line y = x. But since the problem doesn't specify a particular point, maybe we can find the coordinates of Q using the given ratio QC:AQ = 2:3.\n\nWait, the ratio QC:AQ is 2:3. Let's denote the coordinates of Q as (q,q). Then, QC is the distance from Q to C, which is sqrt[(q-5)^2 + (q-5)^2] = sqrt[2(q-5)^2] = sqrt(2)*(q-5). AQ is the distance from Q to A, which is sqrt[(q-0)^2 + (q-0)^2] = sqrt(2)*q. So, QC:AQ = sqrt(2)*(q-5):sqrt(2)*q = (q-5):q. Given that this ratio is 2:3, we can set up the equation:\n\n(q - 5)/q = 2/3\n\nCross-multiplying gives 3(q - 5) = 2q => 3q - 15 = 2q => q = 15. So, the coordinates of Q are (15,15).

So, I need to find all integers x such that when you raise x to the 11th power and divide by 64, the remainder is 27. That seems like a modular exponentiation problem, right? Because in modular arithmetic, raising a number to a power and then taking the modulus gives another number. So, maybe I can use Fermat's Little Theorem here, which states that if p is a prime number and a is an integer not divisible by p, then a^(p-1) ≡ 1 mod p. But in this case, 64 is 2^6, which is not a prime number. So Fermat's Little Theorem doesn't directly apply here. Hmm, maybe I need to use Euler's theorem instead. Euler's theorem states that if a and n are coprime, then a^φ(n) ≡ 1 mod n, where φ(n) is Euler's totient function. Since 64 is 2^6, φ(64) = 64*(1 - 1/2) = 32. So, if x and 64 are coprime, then x^32 ≡ 1 mod 64. But in our case, x is not necessarily coprime with 64. So Euler's theorem might not be directly applicable here. Wait, but maybe I can still use Euler's theorem. Let me check. The problem is x^11 ≡ 27 mod 64. Since 11 and 64 are coprime (gcd(11,64)=1), Euler's theorem would apply. So, x^32 ≡ 1 mod 64.

The proper divisors are all the divisors except 1 and the number itself. Let me start by recalling that the sum of the logarithms of all divisors of a number is equal to the logarithm of the number itself. That's a useful property. So, if I can find the sum of the logarithms of all divisors, then subtracting the logarithm of 1 and the logarithm of 1,000,000, I should get S. Then, rounding that to the nearest integer will give me the answer. Let me verify that.\n\nFirst, the number is 1,000,000. Let's factorize it. 1,000,000 is 10^6, which is 2^6 * 5^6. So, the total number of divisors is (6+1)*(6+1) = 49. The sum of the logarithms of all divisors is log(1,000,000) + log(2^6) + log(5^6). Let me compute each term.\n\nFirst, log(1,000,000). Since 1,000,000 is 10^6, log(1,000,000) = log(10^6) = 6. Then, log(2^6) = 6*log(2), and log(5^6) = 6*log(5). So, the sum of all divisors is 6 + 6*log(2) + 6*log(5). Therefore, S = 6 + 6*log(2) + 6*log(5) = 6*(1 + log(2) + log(5)). Since log(2) + log(5) = log(10) = 1, so S = 6*(1 + 1) = 6*2 = 12. Therefore, S is 12. The integer closest to 12 is 12 itself. Wait, but let me check if I made a mistake in the factorization or the logarithm calculations.\n\nWait, 1,000,000 is 10^6, which is 2^6 * 5^6. So, the total number of divisors is indeed (6+1)*(6+1) = 49. The sum of the logarithms of all divisors is log(1,000,000) + log(2^6) + log(5^6). Let me compute each term again.\n\nlog(1,000,000) = 6. log(2^6) = 6*log(2). log(5^6) = 6*log(5). So, total sum is 6 + 6*log(2) + 6*log(5) = 6*(1 + log(2) + log(5)). Since log(2) + log(5) = log(10) = 1, so S = 6*(1 + 1) = 6*2 = 12. So, S is 12.

So, the total number of divisors is (6+1)*(6+1) = 49. The sum of the logarithms of all divisors is log(1,000,000) + log(2^6) + log(5^6). Let me compute each term.\n\nFirst, log(1,000,000). Since 1,000,000 is 10^6, log(1,000,000) = log(10^6) = 6. Then, log(2^6) = 6*log(2), and log(5^6) = 6*log(5). So, the sum of all divisors is 6 + 6*log(2) + 6*log(5). Therefore, S = 6 + 6*log(2) + 6*log(5) = 6*(1 + log(2) + log(5)). Since log(2) + log(5) = log(10) = 1, so S = 6*(1 + 1) = 6*2 = 12. Therefore, S is 12. The integer closest to 12 is 12 itself. Wait, but let me check if I made a mistake in the factorization or the logarithm calculations.\n\nWait, 1,000,000 is 10^6, which is 2^6 * 5^6. So, the total number of divisors is indeed (6+1)*(6+1) = 49. The sum of the logarithms of all divisors is log(1,000,000) + log(2^6) + log(5^6). Let me compute each term again.\n\nlog(1,000,000) = 6. log(2^6) = 6*log(2). log(5^6) = 6*log(5). So, total sum is 6 + 6*log(2) + 6*log(5) = 6*(1 + log(2) + log(5)). Since log(2) + log(5) = log(10) = 1, so S = 6*(1 + 1) = 6*2 = 12. So, S is 12. Therefore, the integer closest to S is 12.\n\n<answer>\nThe integer closest to S", "e71c071_correct": false}

We have an arithmetic progression starting with an even number. The sum of the odd terms is 33, and the sum of the even terms is 44. We need to find the progression and the number of its terms. Let me start by recalling some properties of arithmetic progressions.\n\nIn an arithmetic progression, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Let's denote the first term as \\( a \\), the common difference as \\( d \\), and the number of terms as \\( n \\). Since the progression starts with an even number, \\( a \\) must be even. The terms of the progression can be written as \\( a, a+d, a+2d, \\ldots, a+(n-1)d \\).\n\nThe odd terms in the progression are those where the position is odd. So, the odd terms are \\( a, a+2d, a+4d, \\ldots, a+(2k-2)d \\), where \\( k \\) is a positive integer. The sum of these odd terms is given as 33. Similarly, the even terms are \\( a+d, a+3d, a+5d, \\ldots, a+(2k-1)d \\), and their sum is 44.\n\nLet me denote the number of odd terms as \\( m \\). Then, the number of even terms is \\( n - m \\). Since the total number of terms is \\( n \\), we have \\( m + (n - m) = n \\), which is always true. So, the number of terms is the same as the number of odd terms.\n\nNow, let's express the sums of the odd and even terms in terms of \\( a \\), \\( d \\), and \\( m \\).\n\nThe sum of the odd terms is:\n\\[ a + (a + 2d) + (a + 4d) + \\ldots + [a + (2k-2)d] \\]\nThis is an arithmetic series with first term \\( a \\), common difference \\( 2d \\), and number of terms \\( m \\). The sum of an arithmetic series is given by \\( \\frac{m}{2} [2a + (m-1)d] \\).

Hmm, let's start by understanding what the brackets mean. The notation [ ] here probably refers to the floor function, which gives the greatest integer less than or equal to the given number. So, the problem is asking for the floor of 10^93 divided by (10^31 + 3), and then taking the last two digits of that result. That means I need to compute 10^93 / (10^31 + 3) and then find the last two digits of that quotient. Since the result might be a decimal, I need to round it down to the nearest integer and then take the last two digits. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's consider the division 10^93 divided by (10^31 + 3). Since 10^93 is a very large number, the denominator (10^31 + 3) is also a large number. However, when we divide 10^93 by (10^31 + 3), the result will be a number slightly less than 10^93 divided by (10^31 + 3). But since we need the floor of this division, the result will be the integer part of that division. So, the problem reduces to finding the integer part of 10^93 / (10^31 + 3), and then taking the last two digits of that integer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approximate the division by considering the denominator as approximately 10^31, since 10^31 is much larger than 3. So, 10^93 divided by (10^31 + 3) is approximately 10^93 / (10^31) = 10^62. But this is an approximation, and the actual result might be slightly less. However, since we need the floor of the division, which is the integer part, the approximation might not be accurate enough. But maybe we can compute the exact value and then take the floor.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to compute the division without actually computing the entire number, but rather by breaking it down into smaller parts. Let me think. Let's denote the denominator as D = 10^31 + 3. Then, 10^93 / D can be written as (10^93 / D) * D. So, the floor of this division is equal to the floor of (10^93 / D) * D. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the floor of (10^93 / D) * D, and then taking the last two digits of that result.\n\nBut computing 10^93 / D is not straightforward.

Then, we need to compute P_n mod n. \n\nFirst, let me recall that if n divides x² - 1, then x² ≡ 1 mod n. So, x² ≡ 1 mod n, which means that x² - 1 ≡ 0 mod n, so x² ≡ 1 mod n. Therefore, x must be a solution to x² ≡ 1 mod n. The solutions to this congruence are x ≡ 1 mod n or x ≡ -1 mod n. But since x < n, the solutions are x ≡ 1 mod n or x ≡ n - 1 mod n. Wait, but n is greater than 1, so n - 1 is less than n. So, the solutions are x ≡ 1 mod n or x ≡ n - 1 mod n. But since x < n, x ≡ 1 mod n is the only solution. So, the only x < n that satisfies x² ≡ 1 mod n is x ≡ 1 mod n. Therefore, the product P_n is just 1, because there's only one such x, which is 1. So, P_n = 1.

But wait, let me check if there's any mistake here.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the product of all positive integers x less than n such that n divides x² - 1\". So, the product is the product of all x < n where x² ≡ 1 mod n. But as I just calculated, the only x < n that satisfies this is x ≡ 1 mod n. So, the product is just 1. Therefore, P_n = 1. Then, 1 mod n is 1. So, the answer should be 1. But let me verify this again.\n\nLet me think step by step. Let's take an example. Suppose n = 2. Then, the only x < 2 is 1. So, x = 1. Then, x² - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0. Since n divides 0, x = 1 is a solution. So, the product P_2 is 1. Then, 1 mod 2 is 1. So, the answer should be 1. Let's check n = 3.

The unit digit is 0, the ten-thousand digit is 2, and the tens, hundreds, and thousands digits are three different digits. The sum of these three numbers is what I need to find. Hmm, let's start by breaking down the problem.\n\nFirst, since the numbers are consecutive even numbers, let's denote them as n, n+2, and n+4. The product of these three numbers is (n)(n+2)(n+4). The problem states that this product is a five-digit number. The ten-thousand digit is 2, so the five-digit number starts with 20000. The unit digit is 0, so the last digit of the product is 0. The tens, hundreds, and thousands digits are three different digits, so the product must be a five-digit number with three different digits in the tens, hundreds, and thousands places.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Since the product is a five-digit number starting with 20000, the product must be between 20000 and 29999. But since the numbers are consecutive even numbers, their product will be a four-digit number at least. Wait, no, actually, the product of three consecutive even numbers is a four-digit number. Let me check that.\n\nLet's take an example. Let's take n=2, so the numbers are 2, 4, 6. Their product is 2*4*6=48. That's a two-digit number. If n=4, the numbers are 4, 6, 8. Product is 4*6*8=192. Still two digits. If n=6, 6*8*10=480. Still two digits. So the product is always a four-digit number. Therefore, the five-digit number must be between 20000 and 29999. So the product is 20000*10=200000. But that's not possible because the product is a four-digit number. Wait, no, the product is (n)(n+2)(n+4). Let's compute the product for n=2: 2*4*6=48. For n=4: 4*6*8=192. For n=6: 6*8*10=480. So the product is 48, 192, 480. So the product is a four-digit number. Therefore, the five-digit number must be 20000*10=200000, which is not possible. Wait, no, the problem says the product is a five-digit number. So the five-digit number is 20000*10=200000, which is not possible. Wait, no, the problem says the product is a five-digit number. So the five-digit number is 20000*10=200000, which is not possible. Wait, no, the problem says the product is a five-digit number. So the five-digit number is 20000*10=200000, which is not possible.

What is the sum of these three consecutive even numbers?\n\n---\n\nPlease note that the translation maintains the original format and line breaks as requested.\n\n<think>\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\n<think>\nAlright, so I need to find three consecutive even numbers whose product is a five-digit number. The unit digit is 0, the ten-thousand digit is 2, and the tens, hundreds, and thousands digits are three different digits. The sum of these three numbers is what I need to find. Hmm, let's start by breaking down the problem.\n\nFirst, since the numbers are consecutive even numbers, let's denote them as n, n+2, and n+4. The product of these three numbers is (n)(n+2)(n+4). The problem states that this product is a five-digit number. The ten-thousand digit is 2, so the five-digit number starts with 20000. The unit digit is 0, so the last digit of the product is 0. The tens, hundreds, and thousands digits are three different digits, so the product must be a five-digit number with three different digits in the tens, hundreds, and thousands places.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Since the product is a five-digit number starting with 20000, the product must be between 20000 and 29999. But since the numbers are consecutive even numbers, their product will be a four-digit number at least. Wait, no, actually, the product of three consecutive even numbers is a four-digit number. Let me check that.\n\nLet's take an example. Let's take n=2, so the numbers are 2, 4, 6. Their product is 2*4*6=48. That's a two-digit number. If n=4, the numbers are 4, 6, 8. Product is 4*6*8=192. Still two digits. If n=6, 6*8*10=480. Still two digits. So the product is always a four-digit number. Therefore, the five-digit number must be between 20000 and 29999. So the product is 20000*10=200000. But that's not possible because the product is a four-digit number. Wait, no, the product is (n)(n+2)(n+4). Let's compute the product for n=2: 2*4*6=48. For n=4: 4*6*8=192. For n=6: 6*8*10=480. So the product is 48, 192, 480. So the product is a four-digit number. Therefore, the five-digit number must be 20000*10=200000, which is not possible. Wait, no, the problem says the product is a five-digit number. So the five-digit number is 20000*10=200000, which is not possible. Wait, no, the problem says the product is a five-digit number. So the five-digit number is 20000*10=200000, which is not possible. Wait, no, the problem says the product is a five-digit number. So the five-digit number is 20000*10=200000, which is not possible. Wait, no, the problem says the product is a five-digit number. So the five-digit number is 2000\n\n<answer>\nThe sum of the three", "e71c071_correct": false}

The total number of socks is not more than 2016. The probability of drawing two socks of the same color is 1/2. We need to find the maximum number of red socks possible. Hmm, let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall that the probability of drawing two socks of the same color is the sum of the probabilities of drawing two red socks and two blue socks. Since these are mutually exclusive events, we can add their probabilities. So, the probability is (number of red socks / total socks) * (number of red socks / total socks) + (number of blue socks / total socks) * (number of blue socks / total socks). According to the problem, this sum is 1/2. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n[number of red socks / total socks]^2 + [number of blue socks / total socks]^2 = 1/2\n\nOur goal is to maximize the number of red socks, which is [number of red socks / total socks]. Let me denote the number of red socks as R and the number of blue socks as B. Then, total socks = R + B. So, the equation becomes:\n\n(R / (R + B))^2 + (B / (R + B))^2 = 1/2\n\nOur task is to maximize R, given that R + B ≤ 2016. Let me try to solve this equation for R.\n\nFirst, let's note that since R and B are non-negative integers, and R + B ≤ 2016, we can express B in terms of R: B = 2016 - R. Then substitute this into the equation:\n\n(R / (R + (2016 - R)))^2 + ((2016 - R) / (R + (2016 - R)))^2 = 1/2\n\nSimplify the denominators:\n\n(R / 2016)^2 + (2016 - R) / 2016^2 = 1/2\n\nLet me denote 2016 as a constant, so let's set x = 2016. Then the equation becomes:\n\n(R / x)^2 + (x - R)^2 / x^2 = 1/2\n\nMultiply both sides by x^2 to eliminate denominators:\n\nx^2 * (R / x)^2 + (x - R)^2 = (1/2) * x^2\n\nSimplify:\n\nx^2 * (R^2 / x^2) + (x^2 - 2xR + R^2) = (1/2)x^2\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nR^2 + x^2 - 2xR + R^2 = (1/2)x^2\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2R^2 - 2xR + x^2 = (1/2)x^2\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n4R^2 - 4xR + 2x^2 = x^2\n\nSubtract x^2 from both sides:\n\n4R^2 - 4xR + x^2 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in R.

Let's denote R as the number of red socks and B as the number of blue socks. Since total socks are R + B, the equation becomes (R / (R + B))^2 + (B / (R + B))^2 = 1/2.\n\nLet's set x = R + B. Then, the equation becomes (R / x)^2 + (B / x)^2 = 1/2. Since R + B = x, we can express B as x - R. Substituting B = x - R into the equation:\n\n(R / x)^2 + (x - R / x)^2 = 1/2\n\nLet's compute (x - R / x)^2:\n\n(x - R / x)^2 = x^2 - 2xR + R^2 / x^2\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n(R / x)^2 + (x^2 - 2", "e71c071_correct": false}

The key here is to understand that P(n) is the product of all possible sums of distinct primes up to n, and we need to determine when n! divides this product.\n\nFirst, let's note that P(n) is the product of all primes up to n, each multiplied by the sum of all primes greater than it. For example, for n=5, the primes are 2, 3, 5, and the sums are 2+3=5, 2+5=7, 3+5=8. So P(5) = 2*3*5*7*8. Similarly, for n=6, the primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, and the sums are 2+3=5, 2+5=7, 2+7=9, 3+5=8, 3+7=10, 5+7=12. So P(6) = 2*3*5*7*9*10*12.\n\nThe problem is asking for n ≥ 3 such that n! divides P(n). So we need to check when n! divides the product of all primes up to n, each multiplied by the sum of all primes greater than it.\n\nLet's start by considering small values of n and see if we can find a pattern or a formula.\n\nFor n=3: The primes are 2 and 3. The sums are 2+3=5. So P(3) = 2*3*5=30. 3! = 6. 6 divides 30, so n=3 works.\n\nFor n=4: The primes are 2, 3, 5. The sums are 2+3=5, 2+5=7, 3+5=8. So P(4) = 2*3*5*7*8=2520. 4! = 24. 24 divides 2520, so n=4 works.\n\nFor n=5: The primes are 2, 3, 5, 7. The sums are 2+3=5, 2+5=7, 2+7=9, 3+5=8, 3+7=10, 5+7=12. So P(5) = 2*3*5*7*9*10*12=25200. 5! = 120. 120 divides 25200, so n=5 works.\n\nFor n=6: The primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11.

When thinking through the problem, please consider the following steps:\n\n1. Understand the problem: You need to find the length of the space diagonal of a cuboid given the lengths of the diagonals of its faces. The cuboid has three pairs of equal-length edges: a, b, c. The diagonals of the faces are XY = 8 cm, YZ = 9 cm, and ZX = √55 cm. The space diagonal is √(a² + b² + c²). \n\n2. Set up equations: Since the cuboid has three pairs of equal-length edges, the diagonals of the faces are the square roots of the sums of the squares of the edges. Therefore, we can write three equations:\n\n   1. a² + b² = 64 (since XY = 8)\n   2. b² + c² = 81 (since YZ = 9)\n   3. a² + c² = 55 (since ZX = √55)\n\n3.

First, the question is about forming ellipses with two elements from the set {1, 2, ..., 11} as m and n in the equation x²/m² + y²/n² = 1. Then, we need to find the number of such ellipses that lie within the rectangular region B, which is defined by |x| < 11 and |y| < 9. The options are given as 43, 72, 86, or 9.\n\nFirst, let's recall that an ellipse is defined by the equation x²/a² + y²/b² = 1, where a and b are the semi-major and semi-minor axes. In our case, the equation is x²/m² + y²/n² = 1, so a² = m² and b² = n². Therefore, the semi-major axis is m and the semi-minor axis is n. The ellipse will be centered at the origin (0,0) and will be oriented along the x-axis if m > n, or along the y-axis if m < n. However, since the problem doesn't specify the orientation, we can assume that the ellipse is centered at the origin and oriented along the x-axis, unless otherwise specified. But since the problem doesn't mention the orientation, we can assume that the ellipse is centered at the origin and oriented along the x-axis. Therefore, the semi-major axis is m and the semi-minor axis is n.\n\nNow, the rectangular region B is defined by |x| < 11 and |y| < 9. So, the region is a rectangle with vertices at (-11, -9), (-11, 9), (11, -9), and (11, 9). The ellipse will be within this rectangle if all points (x, y) on the ellipse satisfy |x| < 11 and |y| < 9. Therefore, the ellipse must lie entirely within the rectangle.\n\nTo find the number of such ellipses, we need to count the number of pairs (m, n) from the set {1, 2, ..., 11} such that the ellipse x²/m² + y²/n² ≤ 1 lies entirely within the rectangle B. Since the ellipse is centered at the origin, the condition for the ellipse to lie within the rectangle is that the ellipse must not extend beyond the boundaries of the rectangle in either the x or y direction.\n\nTherefore, for each pair (m, n), the ellipse will lie within the rectangle if and only if the ellipse does not intersect the boundaries of the rectangle. The boundaries of the rectangle are at x = ±11 and y = ±9. So, the ellipse must not have any points where x = ±11 or y = ±9. Therefore, the ellipse must lie entirely within the region where |x| < 11 and |y| < 9, but not at the boundaries.\n\nTherefore, the number of ellipses is equal to the number of pairs (m, n) such that the ellipse x²/m² + y²/n² ≤ 1 does not intersect the boundaries of the rectangle B.

Let me verify this reasoning step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem states that we need to find the number of ellipses that can be formed within the rectangular region B, which is defined by |x| < 11 and |y| < 9. The equation of the ellipse is x²/m² + y²/n² = 1, where m and n are elements of the set {1, 2, ..., 11}. The number of such ellipses is the number of pairs (m, n) such that the ellipse lies entirely within the rectangle B.\n\nTo determine this, we need to ensure that the ellipse does not intersect the boundaries of the rectangle. The boundaries of the rectangle are at x = ±11 and y = ±9. Therefore, the ellipse must not have any points where x = ±11 or y = ±9. This means that the ellipse must lie entirely within the region where |x| < 11 and |y| < 9, but not at the boundaries.\n\nTherefore, the number of such ellipses is equal to the number of pairs (m, n) such that the ellipse x²", "e71c071_correct": false}

Let me start by understanding what the problem is asking.\n\nFirst, let's recall that the four smallest distinct positive divisors of a number n are the smallest four divisors. For example, if n is 12, its divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. The four smallest distinct divisors would be 1, 2, 3, 4. So, in this case, p1=1, p2=2, p3=3, p4=4. Then, n would be 1² + 2² + 3² + 4² = 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30. So, 30 is one such number. But how do I find all such numbers?\n\nI remember that the four smallest divisors of a number n are related to its prime factorization. Let me think. If n is a prime number, then its divisors are 1 and n. So, the four smallest divisors would be 1 and n. Then, n = 1² + n² = 1 + n². But n² is much larger than 1, so this equation doesn't make sense. Therefore, n cannot be a prime number. So, n must be a composite number.\n\nIf n is composite, then its divisors are at least 1, 2, 3, 4. But the problem states that the four smallest distinct positive divisors are p1, p2, p3, p4. So, p1 is the smallest one, which must be 1. Then, p2 is the next smallest, which must be 2. Then, p3 is the next, which must be 3. Then, p4 is the next, which must be 4. But 4 is not a divisor of n, so this is a contradiction. Therefore, n cannot have 4 as a divisor. So, n must be a composite number with at least 5 divisors.\n\nBut how many divisors does n have? Let's recall that the number of divisors of n is equal to (e1 + 1)(e2 + 1)...(ek + 1), where n = p1^e1 * p2^e2 * ... * pk^ek is the prime factorization of n. Since n is composite, at least one of the exponents e1, e2, ..., ek is greater than 1.

The problem gives me some information about point D on side AC, the angle bisector AE, and the ratios AH:HE and BH:HD. Hmm, let's start by visualizing the triangle. Since angle A is 70 degrees, maybe I can use the Law of Sines or some angle relationships here.\n\nFirst, let me note down the given information:\n\n- Angle at A is 70 degrees.\n- D is a point on AC.\n- AE is the angle bisector of angle A.\n- AH:HE = 3:1.\n- BH:HD = 5:3.\n- We need to find angle C.\n\nSince AE is the angle bisector, by the Angle Bisector Theorem, BD/DC = AB/AC. But I don't know AB or AC yet. Maybe I can use the given ratios to express BD and DC in terms of AB and AC.\n\nLet me denote AB = c, AC = b, BC = a. Then, by the Angle Bisector Theorem:\n\nBD/DC = AB/AC = c/b.\n\nBut BD + DC = BC = a. So BD = a/b and DC = a - a/b = a(1 - 1/b). Therefore, BD/DC = (a/b) / (a(1 - 1/b)) = (1/b) / (1 - 1/b) = (1/b) / (b - 1) = 1/(b(b - 1)).\n\nBut we know BD/DC = c/b. So:\n\nc/b = 1/(b(b - 1))\n\nCross-multiplying gives:\n\nc = 1/(b - 1)\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So c is equal to 1/(b - 1). That might be useful later.\n\nNow, let's look at the ratios AH:HE = 3:1. Since AE is the angle bisector, AH is part of the angle bisector. Let me denote AH = 3k and HE = k. Then, since AE is the angle bisector, the ratio of AH to HE is 3:1. So AE = AH + HE = 3k + k = 4k. Therefore, AE = 4k.\n\nSimilarly, BH:HD = 5:3. Let's denote BH = 5m and HD = 3m. Then, BH + HD = BD + DC = a. So 5m + 3m = a => 8m = a => m = a/8.\n\nTherefore, BH = 5m = 5(a/8) = (5a)/8.\n\nSimilarly, HD = 3m = 3(a/8) = (3a)/8.\n\nNow, since AE is the angle bisector, it divides angle A into two equal parts. So angle BAE = angle CAE. Let me denote angle BAE = angle CAE = x. Then, angle BAC = 2x = 70 degrees, so x = 35 degrees.\n\nNow, let's consider triangle ABE. Since AE is the angle bisector, by the Angle Bisector Theorem, BD/DC = AB/AC = c/b. But we already have c = 1/(b - 1). So BD/DC = 1/(b - 1). Let me denote BD = k and DC = (b - 1)k.

Therefore, BD/DC = (a/b) / (a(1 - 1/b)) = (1/b) / (1 - 1/b) = (1/b) / (b - 1) = 1/(b(b - 1)).\n\nBut we know BD/DC = c/b. So:\n\nc/b = 1/(b(b - 1))\n\nCross-multiplying gives:\n\nc = 1/(b - 1)\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So c is equal to 1/(b - 1).

Then, since AE is the angle bisector, the ratio of AH to HE is 3:1. So AE = AH + HE = 3k + k = 4k. Therefore, AE = 4k.\n\nSimilarly, BH:HD = 5:3. Let's denote BH = 5m and HD = 3m. Then, BH + HD = BD + DC = a. So 5m + 3m = a => 8m = a => m = a/8.\n\nTherefore, BH = 5m = 5(a/8) = (5a)/8.\n\nSimilarly, HD = 3m = 3(a/8) = (3a)/8.\n\nNow, since AE is the angle bisector, it divides angle A into two equal parts.

Then, BD + DC = k + (b - 1)k = k(\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\n<think>\nWait, let me check that again. BD/DC = AB/AC = c/b. So BD = c/b and DC = (b - c)/b. Therefore, BD/DC = c/b / (b - c)/b = c/(b - c). But we know BD/DC = 1/(b - 1). So:\n\nc/(b - c) = 1/(b - 1)\n\nCross-multiplying gives:\n\nc(b - 1) = b - c\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\ncb - c = b - c\n\nAdding c to both sides:\n\ncb = b\n\nDividing both sides by b (assuming b ≠ 0):\n\nc = 1\n\nBut c is AB, which is opposite angle A. So angle A is 70 degrees, which is correct. So angle A is 70 degrees. Then angle BAC is 70 degrees, so angle BAC is 70 degrees. Then angle BAE is 35 degrees, so angle BAE is 35 degrees.

Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's denote the initial mass of the first crystal as M1 and the second as M2. The problem states that the first crystal increases its mass over 3 months, and the second over 7 months. So, the mass increase for the first crystal is 3 months, and for the second, it's 7 months. The mass increase for the first crystal after a year (12 months) is 4%, and for the second, it's 5%. We need to find M1/M2.\n\nLet me recall that mass increase can be calculated using the formula: mass increase = initial mass * rate of increase * time. The rate of increase is usually expressed as a percentage, so we need to convert that into a decimal. For example, 4% would be 0.04, and 5% would be 0.05.\n\nSo, for the first crystal, the mass increase over 12 months is 0.04. Let's denote the rate of increase as r1. Then, the mass increase can be written as M1 * r1 * 12 = 0.04. Similarly, for the second crystal, the mass increase over 12 months is 0.05, so M2 * r2 * 12 = 0.05. We need to find M1/M2.\n\nBut we also know that the first crystal increases its mass over 3 months, and the second over 7 months. Let's denote the mass increase over 3 months as 0.03 (since 3 months is 1/4 of a year, and 4% is 0.04, so 3 months would be 0.03). Similarly, the mass increase over 7 months is 0.07 (since 7 months is 7/12 of a year, and 5% is 0.05, so 7 months would be 0.07).\n\nTherefore, we can write two equations:\n\n1.

The problem mentions that W, X, Y, and Z are midpoints of the sides of ABCD, and P is a point on the line segment YZ. Hmm, let me visualize this. ABCD is a parallelogram, so opposite sides are equal and parallel. The midpoints W, X, Y, Z divide each side into two equal parts. So, for example, if AB is a side, then W is the midpoint of AB, so AW = WB. Similarly for the other sides. Now, point P is on YZ, which is a line segment connecting the midpoints of two sides. Since Y and Z are midpoints, YZ is a midline of the parallelogram. Wait, in a parallelogram, the midline connecting two opposite sides is parallel to the other two sides and half their length. So, YZ is parallel to AD and BC, and half their length. Therefore, YZ is a midline, so it's parallel to AD and BC, and half their length. Therefore, YZ is parallel to AD and BC, and half their length. So, YZ is parallel to AD and BC, and half their length. Therefore, YZ is parallel to AD and BC, and half their length.

Let me start by understanding the problem. The sequence is defined by a_0 = sin x, and each subsequent term is given by a_n = (-1)^{[n/2]} * sqrt(1 - a_{n-1}^2), where [n/2] is the integer part of n divided by 2. So, for example, when n is even, [n/2] is n/2, and when n is odd, [n/2] is (n-1)/2. The square root is taken of 1 minus the square of the previous term. The options are sin x, -cos x, -sin x, cos x. Hmm, interesting. Let me see if I can compute a few terms to spot a pattern.\n\nStarting with a_0 = sin x. Then, a_1 = (-1)^{[1/2]} * sqrt(1 - sin^2 x). Since [1/2] is 0, (-1)^0 = 1, and sqrt(1 - sin^2 x) is cos x. So a_1 = cos x. Then, a_2 = (-1)^{[2/2]} * sqrt(1 - cos^2 x). [2/2] is 1, so (-1)^1 = -1, and sqrt(1 - cos^2 x) is sin x. Therefore, a_2 = -sin x. Then, a_3 = (-1)^{[3/2]} * sqrt(1 - sin^2 x). [3/2] is 1.5, so (-1)^1.5 = -1, and sqrt(1 - sin^2 x) is cos x. So a_3 = -cos x. Then, a_4 = (-1)^{[4/2]} * sqrt(1 - cos^2 x). [4/2] is 2, so (-1)^2 = 1, and sqrt(1 - cos^2 x) is sin x. Therefore, a_4 = sin x. Wait, that's the same as a_0. So the sequence seems to repeat every four terms: sin x, cos x, -sin x, -cos x. So the sequence is periodic with period 4. Therefore, a_1989 would be the same as a_1, which is cos x. So the answer should be D) cos x.\n\nBut let me check if I made a mistake.

Hmm, let's start by recalling some trigonometric identities. The first term is a ratio of two sine functions, and the second term is cotangent squared of x/2. Let me see if I can simplify the first term first.\n\nThe numerator is 2 sin x - sin 2x. I remember that sin 2x can be written as 2 sin x cos x. So substituting that in, the numerator becomes 2 sin x - 2 sin x cos x. Let me factor out 2 sin x: 2 sin x (1 - cos x). So the first term simplifies to 2 sin x (1 - cos x)/(2 sin x + sin 2x). The 2 sin x in the numerator and denominator cancels out, leaving (1 - cos x)/(1 + cos x). That's a standard identity. So the first term simplifies to (1 - cos x)/(1 + cos x).\n\nNow, the second term is cot²(x/2). I know that cotangent squared is equal to (cos²(x/2))/(sin²(x/2)). So cot²(x/2) = cos²(x/2)/sin²(x/2). Let me write that as (cos(x/2)/sin(x/2))². That's equivalent to tan²(x/2).

Hmm, let's start by recalling some trigonometric identities. The first term is a ratio of two sine functions, and the second term is cotangent squared of x/2. Let me see if I can simplify the first term first.\n\nThe numerator is 2 sin x - sin 2x. I remember that sin 2x can be written as 2 sin x cos x. So substituting that in, the numerator becomes 2 sin x - 2 sin x cos x. Let me factor out 2 sin x: 2 sin x (1 - cos x). So the first term simplifies to 2 sin x (1 - cos x)/(2 sin x + sin 2x). The 2 sin x in the numerator and denominator cancels out, leaving (1 - cos x)/(1 + cos x). That's a standard identity. So the first term simplifies to (1 - cos x)/(1 + cos x).\n\nNow, the second term is cot²(x/2). I know that cotangent squared is equal to (cos²(x/2))/(sin²(x/2)). So cot²(x/2) = cos²(x/2)/sin²(x/2). Let me write that as (cos(x/2)/sin(x/2))². That's equivalent to tan²(x/2). So the second term becomes tan²(x/2).\n\nSo putting it all together, the equation becomes:\n\n(1 - cos x)/(1 + cos x) + tan²(x/2) = 10/3.\n\nHmm, that looks a bit complicated.

First, I need to recall the Law of Sines, which relates the lengths of the sides of a triangle to the sines of its angles. The Law of Sines states that in any triangle, the ratio of the length of a side to the sine of the opposite angle is the same for all three sides. So, in triangle ABC, we have:\n\na / sin A = b / sin B = c / sin C\n\nGiven that angle C is 3 times angle A, we can write angle C as 3A. Also, we know the lengths of sides a and c, which are 27 and 48, respectively. We need to find the length of side b.\n\nFirst, let me note down the given information:\n\n- Angle C = 3A\n- Side a = 27\n- Side c = 48\n\nWe need to find side b. Let me recall that in a triangle, the sum of the angles is 180 degrees. So, angle A + angle B + angle C = 180 degrees. Since angle C is 3A, angle A + angle B + 3A = 180 degrees. Therefore, angle B = 180 - 4A.\n\nNow, using the Law of Sines, we can write:\n\na / sin A = b / sin B\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n27 / sin A = b / sin B\n\nBut we also know that sin B = sin(180 - 4A) = sin 4A. Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n27 / sin A = b / sin 4A\n\nSo, solving for b:\n\nb = 27 * sin 4A / sin A\n\nBut we need to express sin 4A in terms of sin A. Using the double-angle identity, sin 4A = 2 sin 2A cos 2A. And sin 2A = 2 sin A cos A. Therefore, sin 4A = 2 * 2 sin A cos A * cos 2A = 4 sin A cos A cos 2A.\n\nSo, substituting back into the equation:\n\nb = 27 * (4 sin A cos A cos 2A) / sin A\n\nSimplifying:\n\nb = 27 * 4 cos A cos 2A\n\nBut we need to express cos 2A in terms of sin A and cos A. Using the double-angle identity again, cos 2A = cos² A - sin² A. Therefore:\n\nb = 27 * 4 cos A (cos² A - sin² A)\n\nLet me compute this expression. Let me denote cos A as x and sin A as y. Then, cos 2A = 2x² - 1. So, substituting:\n\nb = 27 * 4 x (2x² - 1)\n\nSimplify:\n\nb = 108 x (2x² - 1)\n\nBut we need to express x and y in terms of a known value.

Hmm, let's start by looking at each factor separately. Maybe I can simplify each quadratic expression first.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first factor: 4x² + 6x + 4. Let me see if I can factor this. The quadratic is 4x² + 6x + 4. Let's check if it's a perfect square trinomial. The first term is 4x², which is (2x)², and the last term is 4, which is (2)². The middle term is 6x, which is 2*2x*1. So, the middle term is 2*2x*1. Therefore, the quadratic factors as (2x + 2)(2x + 2). Let me verify that: (2x + 2)(2x + 2) = 4x² + 4x + 4x + 4 = 4x² + 8x + 4. So, the first factor simplifies to 4(x + 1)^2.\n\nSimilarly, the second factor is 4y² - 12y + 25. Let's check if this is a perfect square. The first term is 4y², which is (2y)², and the last term is 25, which is (5)². The middle term is -12y, which is 2*(-2y)*5. So, the middle term is 2*(-2y)*5. Therefore, the quadratic factors as (2y - 5)(2y - 5). Let me verify that: (2y - 5)(2y - 5) = 4y² - 10y - 10y + 25 = 4y² - 20y + 25. So, the second factor simplifies to 4(y - 5/2)^2.\n\nSo, substituting back into the original equation, we have:\n\n(4(x + 1)^2)(4(y - 5/2)^2) = 28.\n\nSimplify the constants:\n\n4*4 = 16, so 16(x + 1)^2(y - 5/2)^2 = 28.\n\nDivide both sides by 16:\n\n(x + 1)^2(y - 5/2)^2 = 28/16 = 7/4.\n\nSo, (x + 1)^2(y - 5/2)^2 = 7/4.\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\n|x + 1| |y - 5/2| = sqrt(7)/2.\n\nSince we are dealing with real numbers, the absolute values can be positive or negative, but since we are squaring, the signs will cancel out.

Hmm, let's start by looking at each factor separately. Maybe I can simplify each quadratic expression first.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first factor: 4x² + 6x + 4. Let me see if I can factor this. The quadratic is 4x² + 6x + 4. Let's check if it's a perfect square trinomial. The first term is 4x², which is (2x)², and the last term is 4, which is (2)². The middle term is 6x, which is 2*2x*1. So, the middle term is 2*2x*1. Therefore, the quadratic factors as (2x + 2)(2x + 2). Let me verify that: (2x + 2)(2x + 2) = 4x² + 4x + 4x + 4 = 4x² + 8x + 4. So, the first factor simplifies to 4(x + 1)^2.\n\nSimilarly, the second factor is 4y² - 12y + 25. Let's check if this is a perfect square. The first term is 4y², which is (2y)², and the last term is 25, which is (5)². The middle term is -12y, which is 2*(-2y)*5. So, the middle term is 2*(-2y)*5. Therefore, the quadratic factors as (2y - 5)(2y - 5). Let me verify that: (2y - 5)(2y - 5) = 4y² - 10y - 10y + 25 = 4y² - 20y + 25. So, the second factor simplifies to 4(y - 5/2)^2.\n\nSo, substituting back into the original equation, we have:\n\n(4(x + 1)^2)(4(y - 5/2)^2) = 28.\n\nSimplify the constants:\n\n4*4 = 16, so 16(x + 1)^2(y - 5/2)^2 = 28.\n\nDivide both sides by 16:\n\n(x + 1)^2(y - 5/2)^2 = 28/16 = 7/4.\n\nSo, (x + 1)^2(y - 5/2)^2 = 7/4.\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\n|x + 1| |y - 5/2| = sqrt(7)/2.\n\nSince we are dealing with real numbers, the absolute values can be positive or negative, but since we are squaring, the signs will cancel out. So, we can write:\n\n|x + 1| = sqrt(7)/2\n\nand\n\n|y - 5/2| = sqrt(7)/2\n\nTherefore, x + 1 = sqrt(7)/2 or x + 1 = -sqrt(7)/2\n\nand y - 5/2 = sqrt(7)/2 or y - 5/2 = -sqrt(7)/2\n\nSolving for x and\n\n<answer>\nx = sqrt(7)/2 - 1 or x = -sqrt(7)/2 - 1\n\ny = sqrt(7)/2 + 5/2 or y = -sqrt(7)/2 + 5/2\n\nSo, the unique pair of real numbers (x, y) that satisfy the equation is (sqrt(7)/2 - 1, sqrt(7)/2 + 5/2) and (sqrt(7)/2 - 1, -sqrt(7)/2 + 5/2) or vice versa.\n</answer>You are a helpful AI assistant that provides well-reasoned but short responses.

The problem states that the heights of triangle ABC are in the ratio 6:2√3:3, and the circumference of the circumscribed circle is 8π cm. We need to find the lengths of the sides and the measures of the angles of triangle ABC.\n\nFirst, let me recall that the ratio of the heights to the sides is related to the area of the triangle. The area of a triangle can be expressed in terms of its sides and the sine of the opposite angles. Alternatively, the area can be expressed in terms of the heights. Let me denote the sides opposite to angles A, B, C as a, b, c respectively. Then, the area of the triangle can be written as (1/2)*a*h_a = (1/2)*b*h_b = (1/2)*c*h_c, where h_a, h_b, h_c are the heights corresponding to sides a, b, c respectively.\n\nGiven the ratio of the heights is 6:2√3:3, let me denote the heights as 6k, 2√3k, 3k for some positive constant k. Then, the area of the triangle can be expressed as (1/2)*a*(6k) = (1/2)*b*(2√3k) = (1/2)*c*(3k). Let me denote the area as S. Then, we have:\n\nS = (1/2)*a*6k = 3ak\n\nS = (1/2)*b*2√3k = √3bk\n\nS = (1/2)*c*3k = 1.5ck\n\nSince all three expressions equal S, we can set them equal to each other:\n\n3ak = √3bk => 3a = √3b => a = (√3/3)b\n\nSimilarly,\n\n3ak = 1.5ck => 3a = 1.5c => a = (1.5/3)c = (1/2)c\n\nTherefore, we have two expressions for a in terms of b and c:\n\na = (√3/3)b\n\na = (1/2)c\n\nSo, we can set these two expressions equal to each other:\n\n(√3/3)b = (1/2)c\n\nCross-multiplying gives:\n\n2√3b = 3c => c = (2√3/3)b = (2√3/3)b\n\nTherefore, c = (2√3/3)b\n\nNow, we have the sides in terms of b. Let me denote b as a variable. Then, c = (2√3/3)b, and a = (√3/3)b.\n\nNext, we need to find the circumradius R of the triangle. The formula for the circumradius is R = (abc)/(4S), where S is the area of the triangle. Let's compute S first.\n\nFrom the expressions for a, b, c, we can compute S:\n\nS = (1/2)*a*6k = (1/2)*(√3/3)b*6k = (√3/2)*b*k\n\nSimilarly,\n\nS = (1/2)*b*(2√3k) = √3k\n\nS = (1/2)*c*(3k) = (3/2)*c*k\n\nSince all three expressions equal S, we can set them equal to each other:\n\n(√3/2)*b*k = √3k\n\nDivide both sides\n\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant that provides well‑reasoned but short responses.\nYou first briefly think about the reasoning process as an internal monologue and then provide the user with the answer.\nRespond in the following format:\n\nProblem: Task B-3.5.

Then, we have:\n\nS = (1/2)*a*6k = 3ak\n\nS = (1/2)*b*2√3k = √3bk\n\nS = (1/2)*c*3k = 1.5ck\n\nSince all three expressions equal S, we can set them equal to each other:\n\n3ak = √3bk => 3a = √3b => a = (√3/3)b\n\nSimilarly,\n\n3ak = 1.5ck => 3a = 1.5c => a = (1.5/3)c = (1/2)c\n\nTherefore, we have two expressions for a in terms of b and c:\n\na = (√3/3)b\n\na = (1/2)c\n\nSo, we can set these two expressions equal to each other:\n\n(√3/3)b = (1/2)c\n\nCross-multiplying gives:\n\n2√3b = 3c => c = (2√3/3)b = (2√3/3)b\n\nTherefore, c = (2√3/3)b\n\nNow, we have the sides in terms of b. Let me denote b as a variable. Then, c = (2√3/3)b, and a = (√3/3)b.\n\nNext, we need to find the circumradius R of the triangle. The formula for the circumradius is R = (abc)/(4S), where S is the area of the triangle. Let's compute S first.\n\nFrom the expressions for a, b, c, we can compute S:\n\nS = (1/2)*a*6k = (1/2)*(√3/3)b*6k = (√3/2)*b*k\n\nSimilarly,\n\nS = (1/2)*b*(2√3k) = √3k\n\nS = (1/2)*c*(3k) = (3/2)*c*k\n\nSince all three expressions equal S, we can set them equal to each other:\n\n(√3/2)*b*k = √3k\n\nDivide both sides\n\n<answer>\n√3/2 = √3\n\nWhich implies that k = 2.\n\nTherefore, the heights are 6k = 12 cm, 2√3k = 4√3 cm, 3k = 6 cm.\n\nNow, let's compute the area S:\n\nS = (1/2)*a*6k = (1/2)*(√3/3)b*12 = (√3/2)*b*6 = 3√3b\n\nAlternatively, S = √3k = √3*6 = 6√3\n\nAlternatively, S = (3/2)*c*k = (3/2)*(2√3/3)b*6 = 3√3b\n\nSo, S = 3√3b = 6√3\n\nTherefore, 3√3b = 6√3 => b = 2.\n\nThen, c = (2√3/3)b = (2√3/3)*2 = (4√3)/3.\n\na = (√3/3)b = (√3/3)*2 = 2√3/3.\n\nTherefore, the sides are a = 2√3", "e71c071_correct": false}

The first time, they put too little salt, so they added salt at the table. The next time, they added twice as much salt as the first time, but still had to add salt at the table. They used half as much salt as the first time.\n\nWe need to find the fraction of the necessary amount of salt that the cook put in the first time. Let me denote the necessary amount of salt as S. The first time, they added S/2 salt at the table, so the total amount of salt added is S/2. The second time, they added twice as much, which is 2*(S/2) = S. But they still had to add salt at the table, so the total amount added is S. Therefore, the amount added at the table is S - S/2 = S/2. So, the amount added at the table is S/2, which is half of the necessary amount S. Therefore, the fraction of the necessary amount of salt that the cook put in the first time is 1/2.\n\nWait, let me verify this. If the first time they added S/2 salt, and the second time they added S salt, but still had to add salt at the table, which is S - S/2 = S/2. So, S/2 is half of S. Therefore, the fraction is 1/2. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can set up equations. Let's denote the necessary amount of salt as S. Let's say the first time they added x amount of salt at the table. Then, the second time, they added 2x salt at the table. But they still had to add salt at the table, so the total amount added at the table is 2x - x = x. So, x = S/2. Therefore, the fraction is 1/2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first time they added S/2 salt at the table, so the total amount added is S/2.

So, the amount added at the table is S/2, which is half of S. Therefore, the fraction is 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1/2. Let me check if this makes sense.

So, for each rectangle, we need two horizontal lines and two vertical lines. The number of rectangles is then the number of ways to choose two horizontal lines from the total number of horizontal lines and two vertical lines from the total number of vertical lines.\n\nIn a stepped right-angled triangle, the number of horizontal lines is equal to the number of cells along the base, which is 6. Similarly, the number of vertical lines is equal to the number of cells along the height, which is also 6. Therefore, the total number of horizontal lines is 6, and the total number of vertical lines is 6.\n\nThe number of ways to choose two horizontal lines from 6 is given by the combination formula C(6,2). Similarly, the number of ways to choose two vertical lines from 6 is C(6,2). Therefore, the total number of rectangles is C(6,2) * C(6,2).\n\nCalculating C(6,2), which is 6! / (2! * (6 - 2)!), we get 15. So, the total number of rectangles is 15 * 15 = 225.\n\nWait, but let me verify if this is the maximum possible number. The problem states that all the grid lines inside the triangle were outlined. So, the grid lines are the lines that form the triangle and the lines inside the triangle. The maximum number of rectangles would occur when the grid lines are arranged in such a way that they form the most possible rectangles. Since the triangle is right-angled, the grid lines inside the triangle can be arranged in a way that maximizes the number of rectangles.\n\nIn a right-angled triangle, the grid lines inside the triangle can be arranged in a way that forms a grid of rectangles. The maximum number of rectangles in such a grid is achieved when the grid lines are arranged in a way that each rectangle is formed by two horizontal and two vertical lines. Since the triangle has 6 horizontal and 6 vertical lines, the maximum number of rectangles is indeed C(6,2) * C(6,2) = 15 * 15 = 225.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of rectangles that can be found in this drawing is 225.\n\nFinal answer:\n225\nYou are a helpful AI assistant.

Hmm, let's start by understanding what a perfect square is. A perfect square is an integer that can be expressed as the square of another integer. So, for example, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, etc., are perfect squares. The problem is asking for all positive integers n where n² - 19n + 99 is one of these perfect squares. \n\nFirst, let me recall that if a number is a perfect square, then it can be written as k² for some integer k. So, the equation n² - 19n + 99 = k² must hold for some integer k. Therefore, I need to find all positive integers n such that n² - 19n + 99 - k² = 0. Let me rearrange this equation:\n\nn² - 19n + 99 - k² = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in n. For n to be an integer, the discriminant of this quadratic must be a perfect square. The discriminant D is given by:\n\nD = (-19)² - 4*1*(99 - k²) = 361 - 396 + 4k² = 4k² - 35\n\nSo, D = 4k² - 35 must be a perfect square. Let me denote D = m² for some integer m. Therefore:\n\n4k² - 35 = m²\n\nRearranging this equation:\n\n4k² - m² = 35\n\nThis is a difference of squares, which can be factored as:\n\n(2k - m)(2k + m) = 35\n\nNow, since 35 factors into 1*35, 5*7, and -1*(-35). Let me consider each case.\n\nCase 1: 2k - m = 1 and 2k + m = 35\n\nAdding these two equations:\n\n4k = 36 => k = 9\n\nSubtracting them:\n\n2m = 34 => m = 17\n\nSo, k = 9, m = 17. Then, substituting back into the equation:\n\n4k² - 35 = 17² = 289\n\nBut 4k² - 35 = 4*81 - 35 = 324 - 35 = 289, which is correct.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, since p and q are primes, they can be 2 or 3 because 2 and 3 are the only primes less than 7. But since 7p + q and pq + 11 are also primes, we need to check which primes p and q satisfy these conditions. Let's start with p = 2.\n\nIf p = 2, then 7*2 + q = 14 + q. Since 14 + q must be a prime number. Let's check possible q values:\n\nIf q = 2: 14 + 2 = 16, which is not prime.\nIf q = 3: 14 + 3 = 17, which is prime. So q = 3 is a candidate.\n\nIf q = 5: 14 + 5 = 19, which is prime. So q = 5 is another candidate.\n\nIf q = 7: 14 + 7 = 21, which is not prime.\n\nSo p = 2 and q = 3 or q = 5. Let's check both cases.\n\nCase 1: p = 2, q = 3.\n\nCheck 7p + q: 7*2 + 3 = 14 + 3 = 17, which is prime. Check pq + 11: 2*3 + 11 = 6 + 11 = 17, which is also prime. So both conditions are satisfied here.\n\nCase 2: p = 2, q = 5.\n\nCheck 7p + q: 7*2 + 5 = 14 + 5 = 19, which is prime. Check pq + 11: 2*5 + 11 = 10 + 11 = 21, which is not prime.\n\nSo case 2 is invalid. Therefore, the only valid case is p = 2, q = 3.\n\nNow, we need to compute (p² + q^p)(q² + p^q) = (4 + 3^2)(9 + 2^3) = (4 + 9)(9 + 8) = 13*17.\n\nCalculating 13*17: 13*10=130, 13*7=91, so 130+91=221. Therefore, the answer is 221.\n\nWait, let me verify again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's check the conditions again.\n\nFor p=2, q=3:\n\n7p + q = 14 + 3 = 17, which is prime.\n\npq + 11 = 2*3 + 11 = 6 + 11 = 17, which is prime.\n\nSo both conditions are satisfied. Then, (p² + q^p)(q² + p^q) = (4 + 9)(9 + 8) = 13*17 = 221. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I missed something.

But since 7p + q and pq + 11 are also primes, we need to check which primes p and q satisfy these conditions. Let's start with p = 2.\n\nIf p = 2, then 7*2 + q = 14 + q. Since 14 + q must be a prime number. Let's check possible q values:\n\nIf q = 2: 14 + 2 = 16, which is not prime.\nIf q = 3: 14 + 3 = 17, which is prime. So q = 3 is a candidate.\n\nIf q = 5: 14 + 5 = 19, which is prime. So q = 5 is another candidate.\n\nIf q = 7: 14 + 7 = 21, which is not prime.\n\nSo p = 2 and q = 3 or q = 5. Let's check both cases.\n\nCase 1: p = 2, q = 3.\n\nCheck 7p + q: 7*2 + 3 = 14 + 3 = 17, which is prime. Check pq + 11: 2*3 + 11 = 6 + 11 = 17, which is also prime. So both conditions are satisfied here.\n\nCase 2: p = 2, q = 5.\n\nCheck 7p + q: 7*2 + 5 = 14 + 5 = 19, which is prime. Check pq + 11: 2*5 + 11 = 10 + 11 = 21, which is not prime.\n\nSo case 2 is invalid. Therefore, the only valid case is p = 2, q = 3.\n\nNow, we need to compute (p² + q^p)(q² + p^q) = (4 + 3^2)(9 + 2^3) = (4 + 9)(9 + 8) = 13*17.\n\nCalculating 13*17: 13*10=130, 13*7=91, so 130+91=221. Therefore, the answer is 221.\n\nWait, let me verify again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's check the conditions again.\n\nFor p=2, q=3:\n\n7p + q = 14 + 3 = 17, which is prime.\n\npq + 11 = 2*3 + 11 = 6 + 11 = 17, which is prime.\n\nSo both conditions are satisfied. Then, (p² + q^p)(q² + p^q) = (4 + 9)(9 + 8) = 13*17 = 221. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I missed something. Let me check if there are other primes p and q that satisfy the conditions.\n\n<answer>\nThe value of (p² + q^p)(q² + p^q) is 221.\n</answer>You first briefly think about the reasoning process as an internal monologue and then provide the user with the answer.\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the value of (p² + q^p)(q² + p^q) where p and q are prime numbers, and both 7p + q and pq + 11 are also prime numbers.

The snail is crawling in a straight line, moving forward and then backward each day. The distance it crawls forward each day is increasing by 1/2 m, and the distance it crawls backward is also increasing by 1/2 m each day. So, on the first day, it crawls 1 m forward and 0.5 m backward. On the second day, it crawls 0.5 m forward and 0.333... m backward. On the third day, it crawls 0.333... m forward and 0.25 m backward, and so on.\n\nTo find out how far from the starting point the snail is at the end of the 74th day, we need to calculate the net distance it has crawled forward minus the net distance it has crawled backward over 74 days.\n\nLet me first calculate the net distance crawled forward each day. On the first day, it crawls 1 m forward. On the second day, it crawls 0.5 m forward. On the third day, it crawls 0.333... m forward. So, the net distance crawled forward each day is 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 m, 0.5 - 0.333... = 0.166..., 0.333... - 0.25 = 0.083..., and so on. So, the net distance crawled forward each day forms a geometric series with the first term a = 0.5 and common ratio r = 0.5.\n\nSimilarly, the net distance crawled backward each day is 0.5 m, 0.333... m, 0.25 m, and so on. So, the net distance crawled backward each day also forms a geometric series with the first term a = 0.5 and common ratio r = 0.5.\n\nTherefore, the total distance crawled forward over 74 days is the sum of the first 74 terms of this geometric series. The sum of the first n terms of a geometric series is given by S_n = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r). Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nS_forward = 0.5 * (1 - (0.5)^{74}) / (1 - 0.5) = 0.5 * (1 - (0.5)^{74}) / 0.5 = 1 - (0.5)^{74}\n\nSimilarly, the total distance crawled backward over 74 days is the sum of the first 74 terms of the geometric series with a = 0.5 and r = 0.5. So:\n\nS_backward = 0.5 * (1 - (0.5)^{74}) / (1 - 0.5) = 0.5 * (1 - (0.5)^{74}) / 0.5 = 1 - (0.5)^{74}\n\nTherefore, the net distance from the starting point is the difference between the total distance crawled forward and the total distance crawled backward:\n\nNet distance = S_forward - S_backward = (1 - (0.5)^{74}) - (1 - (0.5)^{74}) = 0\n\nWait, that seems counterintuitive.

This is because each segment can be either horizontal or vertical, and there are 40 segments. Each segment has two possible orientations, so the total number of possible orientations is 2^40. However, since the problem states that the answer can be given in the form of a formula, without necessarily reducing it to a number, the answer is 2^40. But since 2^40 is a very large number, perhaps the answer is expressed in terms of 2^40.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the left side of the inequality. The expression (1/2)(e^x + e^{-x}) is the hyperbolic cosine function, cosh(x). So, the inequality becomes cosh(x) ≤ e^{λx^2} for all x. Since cosh(x) is always greater than or equal to 1 for all real x, the inequality must hold with equality for all x. Therefore, the right side must also be equal to 1 for all x. So, e^{λx^2} = 1 for all x. Let's see what that implies.\n\nIf e^{λx^2} = 1 for all x, then the exponent must be zero. Because e^0 = 1. So, λx^2 = 0 for all x. But x can be any real number, so the only way this can be true is if λ = 0. Let me check if λ = 0 works. If λ = 0, then e^{0x^2} = e^0 = 1, which is equal to 1 for all x. So, the inequality becomes cosh(x) ≤ 1 for all x, which is true because cosh(x) is always greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, λ = 0 is a solution.\n\nBut wait, let me verify if there are any other possible values of λ. Let's consider the case when λ ≠ 0. If λ ≠ 0, then e^{λx^2} = 1 only when λx^2 = 0, which again implies λ = 0. So, the only possible value is λ = 0. Therefore, the answer should be λ = 0. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this. Let's think about the function f(x) = e^{λx^2} - cosh(x). The inequality becomes f(x) ≤ 0 for all x. So, f(x) must be non-positive for all real x. Let's analyze f(x) = e^{λx^2} - cosh(x). To find where this function is non-positive, we can look at its derivative.\n\nLet's compute f'(x). The derivative of e^{λx^2} is 2λx e^{λx^2}, and the derivative of cosh(x) is sinh(x).

Hmm, let me think. Since I have a compass and a ruler, I can probably use some geometric constructions to find the line. Let me recall that if a line is parallel to another, they don't intersect, and if they bisect the area, they divide the triangle into two equal parts. So, maybe I can find a line that's parallel to l and passes through the midpoint of the triangle's base? Wait, but the problem says \"bisects the area of triangle ABC,\" so the line must pass through the centroid of the triangle. The centroid is the point where the medians intersect, and it divides each median into a ratio of 2:1. So, if I can find the centroid, then the line through it parallel to l will bisect the area. But how do I find the centroid?\n\nFirst, I remember that the centroid of a triangle can be found by averaging the coordinates of the three vertices. Let me denote the triangle as ABC, with coordinates A, B, C. Let me assign coordinates to these points. Let me set point A at the origin (0,0), point B at (2,0), and point C at (0,2). This is a right-angled triangle with legs of length 2. Then, the centroid G would be at (1,1). So, the centroid is at (1,1). Now, the line through G parallel to l must have the same slope as l. But l is a straight line, so its slope is m. The line through G parallel to l would have the same slope m. So, the equation of this line is y - 1 = m(x - 1). But l is a straight line, so its equation is y = mx + c. Since the line through G is parallel to l, the slope m must be equal to the slope of l. So, the equation of the line is y = mx + c, where m = slope of l, and c is the y-intercept. But we don't know the slope of l, but we can find the equation of the line through G parallel to l.\n\nBut how do I find the slope of l? The problem doesn't specify the line l.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem. Since all primes are positive integers greater than 1, and they are ordered from smallest to largest, the quadruple must consist of four distinct primes. Also, the sum of their pairwise products is 882. That seems like a large number, so maybe there are only a few primes that can satisfy this condition. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's note that the sum of four primes is 882. Since primes are odd except for 2, which is the only even prime, the sum of four primes would be even. 882 is even, so that's a good start. But 882 divided by 2 is 441. So, the sum of four primes is 441. That's a much smaller sum than the pairwise products, which is 882. So, the pairwise products are larger than the sum of the primes. That might mean that the primes are relatively small. Let me check if 2 is one of the primes. If 2 is included, then the sum of the remaining three primes would be 441 - 2 = 439. But 439 is a prime number. Let's check if 439 is prime. The square root of 439 is approximately 20.93, so we need to check divisibility by primes up to 20. 439 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, or 19. Therefore, 439 is prime. So, if 2 is one of the primes, then the other three primes must be 439, and the sum of the pairwise products would be 882 - 2*439 = 882 - 878 = 4. But 4 is not a product of three primes. So, 2 cannot be one of the primes. Therefore, all four primes must be odd. Since all primes except 2 are odd, the sum of four odd primes is even. But 882 is even, so that's consistent. So, all primes in the quadruple must be odd.\n\nNow, let's consider the smallest primes. The smallest primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, etc. Since the primes must be ordered from smallest to largest, the quadruple must start with the smallest prime, which is 2. But if 2 is the smallest prime, then the sum of the remaining three primes would be 441 - 2 = 439. As we saw earlier, 439 is prime. So, if 2 is the smallest prime, then the other three primes must be 439, and the sum of the pairwise products would be 882 - 2*439 = 4. But 4 is not a product of three primes.

Let me recall that for a quartic equation, the roots can be arranged in a cyclic manner, and the ratios between consecutive roots are equal. This is similar to the roots of a quadratic equation, where the ratio between consecutive roots is constant. For a quartic, there are four roots, so the ratios between consecutive roots would be equal. Let me denote the roots as r₁, r₂, r₃, r₄. Then, the ratios r₂/r₁ = r₃/r₂ = r₄/r₃ = k, where k is a constant. Since the equation is symmetric, the roots can be arranged in a cyclic order, so the ratios between consecutive roots are equal. Therefore, the equation can be written as (x - r₁)(x - r₂)(x - r₃)(x - r₄) = 0. Expanding this, we get x⁴ - (r₁ + r₂ + r₃ + r₄)x³ + (r₁r₂ + r₁r₃ + r₁r₄ + r₂r₃ + r₂r₄ + r₃r₄)x² - (r₁r₂r₃ + r₁r₂r₄ + r₁r₃r₄ + r₂r₃r₄)x + r₁r₂r₃r₄ = 0. Comparing this with the given equation x⁴ + p x² + q = 0, we can see that the coefficients of x² and the constant term must match. So, the coefficient of x² is 0, which is already satisfied. The coefficient of x² is the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time, which is r₁r₂ + r₁r₃ + r₁r₄ + r₂r₃ + r₂r₄ + r₃r₄. Therefore, we have r₁r₂ + r₁r₃ + r₁r₄ + r₂r₃ + r₂r₄ + r₃r₄ = 0. The constant term is r₁r₂r₃r₄ = q. So, q = r₁r₂r₃r₄. Therefore, q is the product of the roots.

Let me recall that for a quartic equation, the roots can be arranged in a cyclic manner, and the ratios between consecutive roots are equal. This is similar to the roots of a quadratic equation, where the ratio between consecutive roots is constant. For a quartic, there are four roots, so the ratios between consecutive roots would be equal. Let me denote the roots as r₁, r₂, r₃, r₄. Then, the ratios r₂/r₁ = r₃/r₂ = r₄/r₃ = k, where k is a constant. Since the equation is symmetric, the roots can be arranged in a cyclic order, so the ratios between consecutive roots are equal. Therefore, the equation can be written as (x - r₁)(x - r₂)(x - r₃)(x - r₄) = 0. Expanding this, we get x⁴ - (r₁ + r₂ + r₃ + r₄)x³ + (r₁r₂ + r₁r₃ + r₁r₄ + r₂r₃ + r₂r₄ + r₃r₄)x² - (r₁r₂r₃ + r₁r₂r₄ + r₁r₃r₄ + r₂r₃r₄)x + r₁r₂r₃r₄ = 0.

The constant term is r₁r₂r₃r₄ = q. So, q = r₁r₂r₃r₄. Therefore, q is the product of the roots. The coefficient of x is the sum of the products of the roots taken three at a time, which is r₁r₂r₃ + r₁r₂r₄ + r₁r₃r₄ + r₂r₃r₄. Therefore, p = -(r₁r₂r₃ + r₁r₂r₄ + r₁r₃r₄ + r₂r₃r₄). So, p is the negative of the sum of the products of the roots taken three at a time. Therefore, p = -(r₁r₂r₃ + r₁r₂r₄ + r₁r₃r₄ + r₂r₃r₄).

Hmm, let's start by understanding the function better.\n\nFirst, since a and b are positive integers, their product ab is also positive. The denominator ab - 1 is ab - 1, which is positive if ab > 1 and negative if ab < 1. But since a and b are positive integers, ab is always positive, so the denominator is positive. Therefore, the function f(a, b) is defined for all positive integers a and b with ab ≠ 1. So, the domain of f(a, b) is all positive integers a and b except when ab = 1. That means when ab = 1, the denominator becomes zero, which would make the function undefined. So, we need to exclude those cases.\n\nNow, let's try to simplify the function f(a, b). Let's see if we can factor the numerator or find a pattern. The numerator is a² + ab + b². Let's see if this can be factored. Maybe it's a sum of squares? Let's try to write it as (a + b)² - ab. Let's check:\n\n(a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b²\n\nSo, a² + ab + b² = (a + b)² - ab\n\nTherefore, the numerator can be written as (a + b)² - ab. Let's substitute this into the function:\n\nf(a, b) = [(a + b)² - ab]/(ab - 1)\n\nNow, let's simplify the numerator:\n\n(a + b)² - ab = a² + 2ab + b² - ab = a² + ab + b²\n\nSo, the numerator simplifies to a² + ab + b², which is exactly the numerator of the function. Therefore, the function simplifies to:\n\nf(a, b) = (a² + ab + b²)/(ab - 1)\n\nHmm, interesting. So, the function is equal to (a² + ab + b²)/(ab - 1). Let me check if this simplification is correct. Let's compute both sides for a few values of a and b to see if they match.\n\nLet's take a = 2, b = 3:\n\nLeft side: f(2, 3) = (2² + 2*3 + 3²)/(2*3 - 1) = (4 + 6 + 9)/(6 - 1) = 19/5 = 3.8\n\nRight side: (2² + 2*3 + 3²)/(2*3 - 1) = 19/5 = 3.8\n\nYes, they match. So, the function is indeed equal to (a² + ab + b²)/(ab - 1). Therefore, the function f(a, b) is a rational function with numerator a² + ab + b² and denominator ab - 1.\n\nNow, since a and b are positive integers, the numerator is a quadratic in terms of a and b.

Similarly, BBBB is a four-digit number, so BBBB = 1000B + 100B + 10B + B = 1111B.

The altitude from A to BC is H, so AH is perpendicular to BC. E is on AC, so AE and EC are parts of AC. Let me sketch this mentally.\n\nFirst, since angle at C is 90 degrees, triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle with right angle at C. Let me denote the lengths of the sides: BC = a, AC = b, AB = c. Since angle at C is 90 degrees, sides opposite to angles A and B are a and b, respectively. The altitude from A to BC is AH, so AH is perpendicular to BC. Therefore, AH is the height of the triangle.

Let me find the coordinates of E. Since AC is from (a,0) to (0,b), the equation of AC is y = -b/x * x + b. The angle bisector from B(a,0) to AC. The angle bisector theorem tells us that the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides. So, in triangle BEA, BE is the angle bisector of angle B, so AE/EC = AB/BC = c/a. Since AB = c, BC = a, and AC = b. Therefore, AE/EC = c/a. Let me denote AE = k and EC = (c/a)k. Then, since AE + EC = AC = b, we have k + (c/a)k = b. So,\n\n<answer>\n45 degrees.\n</answer>You are a helpful AI assistant that provides well-reasoned but short responses.

Let me start by understanding what a perfect cube is. A perfect cube is a number that can be expressed as n^3, where n is an integer. So, I need to find all integers n such that n^3 divides 9^4. That means 9^4 must be divisible by n^3. Let me write that down:\n\n9^4 divided by n^3 equals some integer. So, 9^4 = n^3 * k, where k is an integer. Since 9 is 3^2, I can rewrite 9^4 as (3^2)^4 = 3^8. Therefore, 3^8 divided by n^3 equals k. So, 3^8 = n^3 * k. To find n, I need to factorize 3^8 and see what factors of n^3 are needed to make this equation true.\n\nFirst, let's factorize 3^8. Since 3^8 is a power of 3, it's already in its prime factorized form. Now, n^3 is a cube, so n must be a cube of some integer. Let's denote n as m^3, where m is an integer. Then, substituting n with m^3 in the equation:\n\n3^8 = (m^3)^3 * k = m^9 * k. So, 3^8 = m^9 * k. To solve for m, we need to divide both sides by k. But k is an integer, so m must be a multiple of 3. Let's see why. If m is not a multiple of 3, then m^9 would not be divisible by 3^8. Therefore, k must be a multiple of 3^8 divided by m^9. But since k is an integer, m must be a multiple of 3 to make the equation hold. So, m must be a multiple of 3. Let's denote m as 3^a * b, where a is a non-negative integer and b is not divisible by 3. Then, m^9 = (3^a * b)^9 = 3^(9a) * b^9. Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n3^8 = 3^(9a) * b^9 * k.\n\nDividing both sides by 3^8:\n\n1 = 3^(9a - 8) * b^9 * k.\n\nSince 3^(9a - 8) is a power of 3, and 1 is 3^0, the equation simplifies to:\n\n3^0 = 3^(9a - 8) * b^9 * k.\n\nTherefore, 0 = 3^(9a - 8) * b^9 * k. Since 3^(9a - 8) is a positive power of 3, and b^9 is a positive integer, k must be 1. Therefore, the equation reduces to:\n\n0 = 3^(9a - 8) * b^9.\n\nBut since 3^(9a - 8) is positive, and b^9 is positive, the only way this can be true is if both sides are zero. But 3^(9a - 8) is positive, so the only way this can be zero is if b^9 is zero, which is impossible since b is a positive integer.

Let's denote m as 3^a * b, where a is a non-negative integer and b is not divisible by 3. Then, m^9 = (3^a * b)^9 = 3^(9a) * b^9.

How many kg of dried mushrooms can be obtained from 20 kg of fresh mushrooms?\n\n<think>\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\nThe problem is about converting fresh mushrooms into dried mushrooms by removing water. The key points are:\n\n1. Fresh mushrooms contain 80% water by mass.\n2. Dried mushrooms contain 20% water by mass.\n3. We need to find how many kg of dried mushrooms can be obtained from 20 kg of fresh mushrooms.\n\nTo solve this, we can set up a ratio between the mass of fresh mushrooms and the mass of dried mushrooms. Since the water content is removed during drying, the mass of the dried mushrooms will be the mass of the fresh mushrooms minus the mass of the water removed. The water removed is 80% of the fresh mushrooms' mass, so the dried mushrooms' mass will be 20% of the fresh mushrooms' mass.\n\nLet me calculate the mass of water in the fresh mushrooms. If fresh mushrooms are 80% water, then the mass of water is 80% of 20 kg. Let's compute that:\n\nMass of water in fresh mushrooms = 80% of 20 kg = 0.80 * 20 kg = 16 kg.\n\nTherefore, the mass of the dried mushrooms will be the total mass minus the mass of water. So, the mass of dried mushrooms = 20 kg - 16 kg = 4 kg.\n\nAlternatively, we can set up a ratio. The ratio of fresh mushrooms to dried mushrooms is equal to the ratio of the mass of water in fresh mushrooms to the mass of water in dried mushrooms. Since the water content is removed, the ratio of fresh to dried is the inverse of the ratio of water in fresh to water in dried.\n\nLet's denote the mass of fresh mushrooms as F and the mass of dried mushrooms as D. The water content in fresh mushrooms is 80% of F, and in dried mushrooms is 20% of D. Therefore, the ratio of fresh to dried is (80% of F) / (20% of D) = (0.80 * F) / (0.20 * D) = (4/5) * (F/D). Since the ratio of fresh to dried is equal to the inverse of the ratio of water in fresh to water in dried, we have:\n\nF / D = (4/5) * (D / F)\n\nSolving for D:\n\nF / D = (4/5) * (D / F)\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n5F = 4D\n\nTherefore, D = (5/4) * F\n\nGiven that F = 20 kg, we can substitute:\n\nD = (5/4) * 20 kg = 25 kg\n\nSo, the mass of dried mushrooms is 25 kg. Let me verify this with the water content calculation.\n\nIf we take 20 kg of fresh mushrooms, 80% is water, so 16 kg of water. Then, the mass of dried mushrooms is 20 kg - 16 kg = 4 kg. The water content in the dried mushrooms is 20% of 4 kg, which is 0.20 * 4 kg = 0.8 kg. The water content in the fresh mushrooms is 16 kg, which is 80% of 20 kg. The difference is 16 kg - 0.8 kg = 15.2 kg, which is 80% of 20 kg. That's correct. So, the answer is 25 kg.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 25 kg.\n</answer>\n\nThe answer\n\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant that provides well‑reasoned but short responses.\nYou first briefly think about the reasoning process as an internal monologue and then provide the user with the answer.\nRespond in the following format:\n\nProblem: 1.

The key points are:\n\n1. Fresh mushrooms contain 80% water by mass.\n2. Dried mushrooms contain 20% water by mass.\n3. We need to find how many kg of dried mushrooms can be obtained from 20 kg of fresh mushrooms.\n\nTo solve this, we can set up a ratio between the mass of fresh mushrooms and the mass of dried mushrooms. Since the water content is removed during drying, the mass of the dried mushrooms will be the mass of the fresh mushrooms minus the mass of the water removed. The water removed is 80% of the fresh mushrooms' mass, so the dried mushrooms' mass will be 20% of the fresh mushrooms' mass.\n\nLet me calculate the mass of water in the fresh mushrooms. If fresh mushrooms are 80% water, then the mass of water is 80% of 20 kg. Let's compute that:\n\nMass of water in fresh mushrooms = 80% of 20 kg = 0.80 * 20 kg = 16 kg.\n\nTherefore, the mass of the dried mushrooms will be the total mass minus the mass of water. So, the mass of dried mushrooms = 20 kg - 16 kg = 4 kg.\n\nAlternatively, we can set up a ratio. The ratio of fresh mushrooms to dried mushrooms is equal to the ratio of the mass of water in fresh mushrooms to the mass of water in dried mushrooms. Since the water content is removed, the ratio of fresh to dried is the inverse of the ratio of water in fresh to water in dried.\n\nLet's denote the mass of fresh mushrooms as F and the mass of dried mushrooms as D. The water content in fresh mushrooms is 80% of F, and in dried mushrooms is 20% of D. Therefore, the ratio of fresh to dried is (80% of F) / (20% of D) = (0.80 * F) / (0.20 * D) = (4/5) * (F/D). Since the ratio of fresh to dried is equal to the inverse of the ratio of water in fresh to water in dried, we have:\n\nF / D = (4/5) * (D / F)\n\nSolving for D:\n\nF / D = (4/5) * (D / F)\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n5F = 4D\n\nTherefore, D = (5/4) * F\n\nGiven that F = 20 kg, we can substitute:\n\nD = (5/4) * 20 kg = 25 kg\n\nSo, the mass of dried mushrooms is 25 kg. Let me verify this with the water content calculation.\n\nIf we take 20 kg of fresh mushrooms, 80% is water, so 16 kg of water. Then, the mass of dried mushrooms is 20 kg - 16 kg = 4 kg.

The question is asking into which two segments the circle divides each of the other two sides of the square.\n\nTo solve this, I need to consider the position of the circle relative to the square. Since the circle touches two adjacent sides of the square, the center of the circle must lie along the line that is the perpendicular bisector of the two sides it touches. Because the circle is tangent to two adjacent sides, the center must be equidistant from those two sides. The distance from the center to each side is equal to the radius, which is 13 cm. Therefore, the center of the circle is located at a distance of 13 cm from each of the two adjacent sides.\n\nNow, the other two sides of the square are not adjacent to the sides where the circle is tangent. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square as ABCD, with sides AB, BC, CD, DA. The circle touches sides AB and BC. Let me assume that the circle is tangent to AB at point E and to BC at point F. Then, the center of the circle is somewhere along the line that is the perpendicular bisector of AB and BC. Since AB and BC are adjacent sides, the perpendicular bisector of AB and BC would be the line that is perpendicular to AB and BC and passes through their midpoint. The midpoint of AB is the point where AB and BC meet, which is point B. Similarly, the midpoint of BC is point C.

Let me start by understanding the problem statement. We have four points A, B, C, D on a line in order, with lengths AB = x, AC = y, and AD = z. The segments AB and CD can rotate around points B and C respectively until points A and D coincide, forming a triangle with a definite area. The three inequalities are I. x < z/2, II. y < x + z/2, and III. y < z/2. The options are A) I only, B) II only, C) I and II only, D) II and III only, E) I, II, and III. Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, let's visualize the points on a line. Let's assign coordinates to make it easier. Let's place point A at coordinate 0, point B at coordinate x, point C at coordinate y, and point D at coordinate z. Since the points are in order, the distance between each consecutive pair is x, y, z. So, AB = x, BC = y - x, CD = z - y, DA = z - x.\n\nNow, the segments AB and CD can rotate around points B and C respectively until points A and D coincide. So, when they coincide, point A is at the same position as point D. Let me denote the coordinates of point A as (0, 0) since it's at the origin. Then, point D would be at (z, 0) because DA = z. Point B is at (x, 0) and point C is at (y, 0). When AB and CD coincide, point A is at (0, 0) and point D is at (z, 0). So, the coordinates of A and D are (0, 0) and (z, 0), respectively.\n\nNow, the segments AB and CD can rotate around B and C. Let's consider the rotation of AB around B. Since AB is a segment from (x, 0) to (0, 0), rotating it around B (which is at (x, 0)) would mean that the new position of point A would be such that the distance from B to A is the same as the original distance from B to A, but the direction is rotated. Similarly, rotating CD around C (which is at (y, 0)) would mean that the new position of point D would be such that the distance from C to D is the same as the original distance from C to D, but the direction is rotated.\n\nBut since AB and CD coincide when A and D coincide, the rotation of AB around B and CD around C must result in the same point D. So, the rotation of AB around B should map point A to point D, and the rotation of CD around C should map point C to point D. Therefore, the rotation of AB around B must be such that the new position of A is (z, 0), and the rotation of CD around C must be such that the new position of C is (z, 0). But since CD is from (y, 0) to (z, 0), rotating it around C (which is at (y, 0)) would map C to (z, 0). But since C is already at (y, 0), rotating it around C would not change its position.

The lengths of segments $A B, A C$, and $A D$ are $x, y$, and $z$ respectively. If segments $A B, C D$ can rotate around points $B, C$ respectively until points $A$ and $D$ coincide, forming a triangle with a definite area, then among the following three inequalities:\nI. $x<\\frac{z}{2} ; \\quad$ II. $y<x+\\frac{z}{2}$;\nIII. $y<\\frac{\\tilde{z}}{2}$, which must be satisfied are\n(A) I only.\n(B) II only.\n(C) I and II only.\n(D) II and III only.\n(E) I, II, and III.\n(30th American High School Mathematics Examination, 1979)\n\n<think>\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\n<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out which of the three inequalities must be true given the problem. Let me start by understanding the problem statement. We have four points A, B, C, D on a line in order, with lengths AB = x, AC = y, and AD = z. The segments AB and CD can rotate around points B and C respectively until points A and D coincide, forming a triangle with a definite area. The three inequalities are I. x < z/2, II. y < x + z/2, and III. y < z/2. The options are A) I only, B) II only, C) I and II only, D) II and III only, E) I, II, and III. Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, let's visualize the points on a line. Let's assign coordinates to make it easier. Let's place point A at coordinate 0, point B at coordinate x, point C at coordinate y, and point D at coordinate z. Since the points are in order, the distance between each consecutive pair is x, y, z. So, AB = x, BC = y - x, CD = z - y, DA = z - x.\n\nNow, the segments AB and CD can rotate around points B and C respectively until points A and D coincide. So, when they coincide, point A is at the same position as point D. Let me denote the coordinates of point A as (0, 0) since it's at the origin. Then, point D would be at (z, 0) because DA = z. Point B is at (x, 0) and point C is at (y, 0). When AB and CD coincide, point A is at (0, 0) and point D is at (z, 0). So, the coordinates of A and D are (0, 0) and (z, 0), respectively.\n\nNow, the segments AB and CD can rotate around B and C. Let's consider the rotation of AB around B. Since AB is a segment from (x, 0) to (0, 0), rotating it around B (which is at (x, 0)) would mean that the new position of point A would be such that the distance from B to A is the same as the original distance from B to A, but the direction is rotated. Similarly, rotating CD around C (which is at (y, 0)) would mean that the new position of point D would be such that the distance from C to D is the same as the original distance from C to D, but the direction is rotated.\n\nBut since AB and CD coincide when A and D coincide, the rotation of AB around B and CD around C must result in the same point D. So, the rotation of AB around B should map point A to point D, and the rotation of CD around C should map point C to point D. Therefore, the rotation of AB around B must be such that the new position of A is (z, 0), and the rotation of CD around C must be such that the new position of C is (z, 0). But since CD is from (y, 0) to (z, 0), rotating it around C (which is at (y, 0)) would map C to (z, 0). But since C is already at (y, 0), rotating it around C would not change its position. Therefore, the rotation of AB around B must map A to D, and the rotation of CD around C must map C\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\n<think>\nWait, let me clarify. When AB and CD coincide, point A is at (0, 0) and point D is at (z, 0). So, the rotation of AB around B (which is at (x, 0)) must map A to D. Similarly, the rotation of CD around C (which is at (y, 0)) must map C to D. But since CD is from (y, 0) to (z, 0), rotating it around C would map C to (z, 0). But since C is already at (y, 0), rotating it around C would not change its position. Therefore, the rotation of AB around B must map A to D, and the rotation of CD around C must map C to D. But since CD is from (y, 0) to (z, 0), rotating it around C would map C to (z, 0). But since C is already at (y, 0), rotating it around C would not change its position. Therefore, the rotation of AB around B must map A to D, and the rotation of CD around C must map C to D. But", "e71c071_correct": false}

The total number of children is 5 girls + 3 boys = 8.

There are n cities, each connected to every other city. So, the number of roads is C(n, 2) = n(n-1)/2. Each road is assigned a number from 1 to m. The priority of a city is the sum of the numbers on the roads leading to it.

Since each city is connected to every other city, the priority of a city depends on the numbers assigned to the roads leading to it.

But we need to find the smallest m where this is possible.\n\nLet's consider the case when n is small. For example, n=3. Then there are 3 cities and 3 roads. Each city is connected to the other two. The priority of each city is the sum of the two numbers on the roads leading to it. So, for each city, the sum is 1 + 2 = 3, 1 + 3 = 4, or 2 + 3 = 5. So the priorities are 3, 4, 5.

The priority of each city is the sum of the three numbers on the roads leading to it. So, for each city, the sum is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, 1 + 2 + 4 = 7, 1 + 3 + 4 = 8, 2 + 3 + 4 = 9. So the priorities are 6, 7, 8, 9. That's four distinct priorities. So m=4 works here. But is this the smallest m?\n\nLet's check n=5. There are 10 roads. Each city is connected to four others. The priority of each city is the sum of the four numbers on the roads leading to it. So, for each city, the sum is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10, 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 11, 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 = 12, 1 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 13, 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 14. So the priorities are 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. That's five distinct priorities. So m=5 works here.

The priority of each city is the sum of the three numbers on the roads leading to it. So, for each city, the sum is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, 1 + 2 + 4 = 7, 1 + 3 + 4 = 8, 2 + 3 + 4 = 9. So the priorities are 6, 7, 8, 9. That's four distinct priorities. So m=4 works here. But is this the smallest m?\n\nLet's check n=5. There are 10 roads. Each city is connected to four others. The priority of each city is the sum of the four numbers on the roads leading to it. So, for each city, the sum is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10, 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 11, 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 = 12, 1 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 13, 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 14. So the priorities are 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. That's five distinct priorities. So m=5 works here. But is this the smallest m?\n\nWait, but if we can assign numbers such that each city has a unique sum, then m must be at least as large as the number of cities. So m ≥ n. But we need to find the smallest m where all cities have different priorities. So m must be at least n, but maybe we can do better.\n\nLet's\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\n<think>\nAlright, so the problem is about assigning numbers from 1 to m to roads between n cities such that each city has a unique sum of the numbers on the roads leading to it. We need to find the smallest m for which this is possible. Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider the case when n is small. For example, n=3. There are 3 cities and 3 roads. Each city is connected to the other two. The priority of each city is the sum of the two numbers on the roads leading to it. So, for each city, the sum is 1 + 2 = 3, 1 + 3 = 4, or 2 + 3 = 5. So the priorities are 3, 4, 5. That's three distinct priorities. So m=3 works here. But is this the smallest m?\n\nLet's check n=4. There are 6 roads. Each city is connected to three others. The priority of each city is the sum of the three numbers on the roads leading to it. So, for each city, the sum is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6", "e71c071_correct": false}

Let's find the coordinates of D and then compute the areas of triangles ADB and ABC.\n\nAlternatively, using vectors. Let me assign coordinates to points A, B, C.\n\nLet me place point B at (0,0), point C at (3√5, 0), and point A at (x, y). Then, the coordinates of D, which is on BC, can be found using the angle bisector theorem. The angle bisector theorem states that the ratio of the segments BD:DC is equal to the ratio of AB:AC. Since AB = √30 and AC = √6, the ratio BD:DC is √30 : √\n\n<answer>\nThe answer is 11.\n</answer>You are a helpful AI assistant that provides well-reasoned but short responses.

For example:\n\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the ratio of the areas of triangles ADB and ABC. The problem gives me a triangle ABC with sides AB = √30, AC = √6, BC = √15. Point D is on BC such that AD bisects BC, and angle ADB is 90 degrees. Then, I need to express this ratio as m/n where m and n are coprime, and find m + n. Hmm, let's start by visualizing the triangle. Since BC is the base, AD is the angle bisector, and angle ADB is 90 degrees, maybe I can use coordinate geometry to model this.\n\nLet me place point B at the origin (0,0) for simplicity.

We need to find the smallest integer \\( n \\geq 3 \\) such that there exists an \\( n \\)-gon and a point inside it where, if a light bulb is placed at that point, on each side of the polygon, there is a point that is not lightened.

Then, we need to prove that for this \\( n \\), there are always two points that light up the entire perimeter.\n\nStarting with \\( n = 3 \\), which is a triangle.

First, let's recall that integrals of this form often involve substitution. The denominator is $x^{2} + 2$, which suggests that a substitution involving the square root might be useful. Let me try setting $u = x^{2} + 2$. Then, the differential $du$ would be $2x dx$, which is exactly twice the numerator of the integrand. So, if I can express the numerator in terms of $du$, the integral becomes straightforward.\n\nLet me see. The numerator is $x dx$. If I divide both sides by 2, I get $\\frac{x dx}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} du$. Therefore, the integral can be rewritten as $\\frac{1}{2} \\int du$. Integrating $du$ with respect to $u$ gives $u + C$, where $C$ is the constant of integration. Now, substituting back for $u$, we have $\\frac{1}{2} (x^{2} + 2) + C$. Let me verify this step by step.\n\nStarting with the original integral: $\\int \\frac{x dx}{x^{2} + 2}$. Let's set $u = x^{2} + 2$. Then, $du = 2x dx$, so $x dx = \\frac{1}{2} du$. Substituting into the integral:\n\n$\\int \\frac{x dx}{x^{2} + 2} = \\int \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} du}{u} = \\frac{1}{2} \\int \\frac{du}{u} = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln |u| + C = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln |x^{2} + 2| + C$.\n\nTherefore, the integral is $\\frac{1}{2} \\ln |x^{2} + 2| + C$. Let me check if this is correct by differentiating it. The derivative of $\\frac{1}{2} \\ln |x^{2} + 2| + C$ with respect to $x$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{x^{2} + 2} \\cdot 2x = \\frac{x}{x^{2} + 2}$. Multiplying numerator and denominator by 2 gives $\\frac{x}{x^{2} + 2} = \\frac{x dx}{x^{2} + 2}$. So, the derivative is indeed the original integrand, confirming that the integral is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2} \\ln |x^{2} + 2| + C}$. Let me also note that since the original integral has a positive denominator, the absolute value is not necessary, but it's good to include it to be thorough. The constant of integration is added at the end, as is standard practice in indefinite integrals. The substitution method is a powerful technique for solving integrals of this form, especially when the denominator is a quadratic polynomial. The key is to find a substitution that simplifies the integral into a more manageable form.

Find the volume of the cone.\n\n<think>\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\nLet me first try to visualize the problem. We have a regular triangular prism ABCA₁B₁C₁. The edge CC₁ is the vertical edge, and point T is on this edge such that CT: C₁T = 1:3. The point T is the vertex of a right circular cone with three vertices of the prism lying on its base. We need to find the ratio of the height of the prism to the edge of its base and then find the volume of the cone given that BB₁ = 8.\n\nFirst, let's recall that in a regular triangular prism, the base is an equilateral triangle, and the lateral edges are equal in length. Let me denote the edge length of the base as 'a' and the height of the prism as 'h'. The lateral edge length is then sqrt(3)*a, since the height of the prism is the altitude of the equilateral triangle base.\n\nGiven that CT: C₁T = 1:3, point T divides the edge CC₁ in the ratio 1:3. Since CC₁ is the vertical edge, the total length of CC₁ is h. Therefore, CT = (1/4)h and C₁T = (3/4)h.\n\nNow, the point T is the vertex of a right circular cone with three vertices of the prism lying on its base. The base of the cone is a circle, and the three vertices of the prism that lie on the base are three vertices of the prism. Since the prism is regular, the three vertices on the base are the three vertices of the base triangle. Let me denote these vertices as A, B, and C.\n\nThe cone has its vertex at T, and the base is a circle. The three vertices A, B, C lie on the circumference of this base. Since the base is a circle, the distance from the center of the base to each of these three points is the radius of the base circle. Let me denote the radius of the base circle as 'r'. Then, the distance from T to each of A, B, C is r.\n\nSince T is on the edge CC₁, which is the vertical edge of the prism, the distance from T to the base is h. Therefore, the distance from T to each of A, B, C is h. So, the radius of the base circle is h.\n\nTherefore, the radius of the base circle is equal to the height of the prism. So, r = h.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the height of the prism to the edge of its base is h : a. But we need to find this ratio. Since the prism is regular, the edge length of the base is 'a', and the height of the prism is 'h'. Since the base is an equilateral triangle, the edge length 'a' is related to the height 'h' of the prism. Let me recall that in a regular triangular prism, the height 'h' is related to the edge length 'a' by the formula h = (sqrt(3)/2)*a. Therefore, the ratio h : a is sqrt(3) : 2.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the height of the prism to the edge of its base is sqrt(3) : 2.\n\nNow, moving on to part b) of the problem. We need to find the volume of the cone given that BB₁ = 8. Since BB₁ is the height of the prism, which is equal to h. Therefore, h = 8.\n\nTherefore, the radius of the base circle is h = 8.

Find the volume of the cone.\n\n<think>\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\nLet me first try to visualize the problem. We have a regular triangular prism ABCA₁B₁C₁. The edge CC₁ is the vertical edge, and point T is on this edge such that CT: C₁T = 1:3. The point T is the vertex of a right circular cone with three vertices of the prism lying on its base. We need to find the ratio of the height of the prism to the edge of its base and then find the volume of the cone given that BB₁ = 8.\n\nFirst, let's recall that in a regular triangular prism, the base is an equilateral triangle, and the lateral edges are equal in length. Let me denote the edge length of the base as 'a' and the height of the prism as 'h'. The lateral edge length is then sqrt(3)*a, since the height of the prism is the altitude of the equilateral triangle base.\n\nGiven that CT: C₁T = 1:3, point T divides the edge CC₁ in the ratio 1:3. Since CC₁ is the vertical edge, the total length of CC₁ is h. Therefore, CT = (1/4)h and C₁T = (3/4)h.\n\nNow, the point T is the vertex of a right circular cone with three vertices of the prism lying on its base. The base of the cone is a circle, and the three vertices of the prism that lie on the base are three vertices of the prism. Since the prism is regular, the three vertices on the base are the three vertices of the base triangle. Let me denote these vertices as A, B, and C.\n\nThe cone has its vertex at T, and the base is a circle. The three vertices A, B, C lie on the circumference of this base. Since the base is a circle, the distance from the center of the base to each of these three points is the radius of the base circle. Let me denote the radius of the base circle as 'r'. Then, the distance from T to each of A, B, C is r.\n\nSince T is on the edge CC₁, which is the vertical edge of the prism, the distance from T to the base is h. Therefore, the distance from T to each of A, B, C is h. So, the radius of the base circle is h.\n\nTherefore, the radius of the base circle is equal to the height of the prism. So, r = h.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the height of the prism to the edge of its base is h : a. But we need to find this ratio. Since the prism is regular, the edge length of the base is 'a', and the height of the prism is 'h'. Since the base is an equilateral triangle, the edge length 'a' is related to the height 'h' of the prism. Let me recall that in a regular triangular prism, the height 'h' is related to the edge length 'a' by the formula h = (sqrt(3)/2)*a. Therefore, the ratio h : a is sqrt(3) : 2.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the height of the prism to the edge of its base is sqrt(3) : 2.\n\nNow, moving on to part b) of the problem. We need to find the volume of the cone given that BB₁ = 8. Since BB₁ is the height of the prism, which is equal to h. Therefore, h = 8.\n\nTherefore, the radius of the base circle is h = 8. Therefore, the radius r = 8.\n\nThe volume of a\n\n<answer>\nThe ratio of the height of the prism to the edge of its base is sqrt(3) : 2. Therefore, the answer to part a) is sqrt(3) : 2.\n\nFor part b), given that BB₁ = 8, which is the height of the prism, the radius of the base circle is 8. The volume of the cone is given by the formula (1/3)*π*r²*h, where r is the radius and h is the height. Plugging in the values, we get (1/3)*π*(8²)*8 = (1/3)*π*64*8 = (512/3)*π. Therefore, the volume of the cone is (512/3)*π.\n\nSo, the volume of the cone is (512/3)*π cubic units.\n</answer>You are a helpful AI assistant that follows instructions carefully.

Let me think about how to approach this. Since the numbers are less than 1000, they can be single-digit, two-digit, or three-digit numbers. But since we're looking for numbers less than 1000, the three-digit numbers are out of the question. So, we only need to consider two-digit numbers. Let me recall that the sum of digits of a two-digit number is the tens digit plus the units digit. So, if the sum is 7, then the tens digit plus the units digit must add up to 7. The tens digit can range from 1 to 9 (since it's a two-digit number), and the units digit can range from 0 to 9. But since the sum is 7, the tens digit can't be 0 because then the units digit would have to be 7, but that would make the number 70, which is less than 1000. So, the tens digit can be from 1 to 9, and the units digit can be from 0 to 7. Wait, but the units digit can't be 7 because then the tens digit would have to be 0, which would make the number 70, which is less than 1000. So, the tens digit can be from 1 to 9, and the units digit can be from 0 to 6. Because if the units digit is 7, the tens digit would have to be 0, which is invalid. So, the possible numbers are those where the tens digit is from 1 to 9, and the units digit is from 0 to 6. So, the total number of such numbers is the number of possible tens digits multiplied by the number of possible units digits. That would be 9 * 7 = 63. So, the answer should be 63. Let me check if I didn't make a mistake. The tens digit can be from 1 to 9, so 9 possibilities. The units digit can be from 0 to 6, so 7 possibilities. So, 9 * 7 = 63. That seems right. So, the answer is 63. Let me just double-check. If I take the smallest possible number, which is 10 (1+0=1), and the largest possible number, which is 99 (9+9=18). The sum of digits is 1+0=1, 9+9=18.

So, the answer is 63. Let me just double-check. If I take the smallest possible number, which is 10 (1+0=1), and the largest possible number, which is 99 (9+9=18). The sum of digits is 1+0=1, 9+9=18. So, numbers from 10 to 99. If I take the next number, which is 11, the sum is 1+1=2. 20 is 2+0=2. 12 is 1+2=3. 13 is 1+3=4. 14 is 1+4=5. 15 is 1+5=6. 16 is 1+6=7. 17 is 1+7=8. 18 is 1+8=9. 19 is 1+9=10. 20 is 2+0=2. 21 is 2+1=3. 22 is 2+2=4. 23 is 2+3=5. 24 is 2+4=6.\n\n<answer>\n63\n</answer>You are a helpful AI assistant that is programmed to provide short, helpful responses.

Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, T is a set of numbers from 10 to 35, since the smallest number is 10*1 + 1 = 11, and the largest is 10*6 + 6 = 66. But wait, the problem says \"10a + b\" where a and b are integers between 1 and 6, with a < b. So, the numbers in T are 11, 12, 13, ..., 35. That's 25 numbers in total. So, T has 25 elements.\n\nNow, S is a subset of T that includes all six digits 1 through 6. So, S must contain at least one number with each of the digits 1 through 6. For example, if S contains the number 12, then it must have the digit 1, and if it contains 13, then it must have the digit 3. Similarly, if S contains 14, then it must have the digit 4, and so on.\n\nBut the key condition is that no three elements in S together use all six digits. So, if S contains numbers with digits 1, 2, and 3, then the total number of digits used by these three numbers must not be 6. For example, if S has 12, 13, and 14, then the total number of digits used is 3 (1, 2, 3) + 3 (1, 2, 4) + 3 (1, 3, 4) = 9, which is more than 6. Therefore, S cannot have three numbers that together use all six digits.\n\nSo, the challenge is to find the largest subset S that meets these two conditions: all six digits are present, and no three elements together use all six digits. The answer will be the maximum size of such a subset S.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Since S must include all six digits, the numbers in S must be composed of the digits 1 through 6. Also, the condition that no three elements together use all six digits is a constraint. So, we need to construct S such that it's as large as possible, but each time we add a new number, we need to check if adding it would violate the condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as a graph where each number in T is a node, and there's an edge between two nodes if the two numbers share at least one digit. Then, S is a subset of T that doesn't contain any three nodes that form a triangle (i.e., no three nodes are all connected). The problem then reduces to finding the largest independent set in this graph.\n\nBut constructing such a graph might be complex. Alternatively, maybe there's a combinatorial approach. Let me try to list all possible numbers in T and see which ones can be included in S without violating the condition.\n\nFirst, let's list all numbers in T. The numbers are 11, 12, 13, ..., 35.

Hmm, let's start by understanding what divisibility means here. If n²(n - 1) is divisible by 2009, then 2009 must be a factor of n²(n - 1). Since 2009 is a product of primes, maybe I can factor 2009 into its prime components and then see how n²(n - 1) must be divisible by each of those primes.\n\nFirst, let's factor 2009. Let's see, 2009 divided by 7 is 287, and 287 divided by 7 is 41. So, 2009 = 7² × 41. So, 2009 is 7 squared times 41. Therefore, for n²(n - 1) to be divisible by 2009, it must be divisible by 7² and 41. So, n²(n - 1) must be divisible by 49 and 41.\n\nNow, since n²(n - 1) is a product of two consecutive integers, one of them must be divisible by 41. Because if n is not divisible by 41, then n - 1 would be divisible by 41, and vice versa. So, either n is divisible by 41, or n - 1 is divisible by 41. Let's consider both cases.\n\nCase 1: n is divisible by 41. Then, n²(n - 1) is divisible by 41. Since 41 is a prime, n²(n - 1) is divisible by 41. So, in this case, we need to check if n²(n - 1) is divisible by 49.\n\nCase 2: n - 1 is divisible by 41. Then, n is divisible by 41. Let's denote n = 41k, where k is an integer. Then, n - 1 = 41k - 1. So, n²(n - 1) = (41k)²(41k - 1). Let's compute this:\n\n(41k)² = 1681k²\n\nThen, (41k - 1) = 41k - 1\n\nSo, n²(n - 1) = 1681k²(41k - 1)\n\nWe need this to be divisible by 49. Let's factor 49 as 7². So, 1681k²(41k - 1) must be divisible by 7².\n\nFirst, let's check 1681. 1681 is 41², so 1681k² is divisible by 41². So, 41²k²(41k - 1) is divisible by 41². Then, we need (41k - 1) to be divisible by 7. Let's set 41k - 1 = 7m, where m is an integer. Then, 41k = 7m + 1, so k = (7m + 1)/41.

Hmm, let's start by understanding what divisibility means here. If n²(n - 1) is divisible by 2009, then 2009 must be a factor of n²(n - 1). Since 2009 is a product of primes, maybe I can factor 2009 into its prime components and then see how n²(n - 1) must be divisible by each of those primes.\n\nFirst, let's factor 2009. Let's see, 2009 divided by 7 is 287, and 287 divided by 7 is 41. So, 2009 = 7² × 41. So, 2009 is 7 squared times 41. Therefore, for n²(n - 1) to be divisible by 2009, it must be divisible by 7² and 41. So, n²(n - 1) must be divisible by 49 and 41.\n\nNow, since n²(n - 1) is a product of two consecutive integers, one of them must be divisible by 41. Because if n is not divisible by 41, then n - 1 would be divisible by 41, and vice versa. So, either n is divisible by 41, or n - 1 is divisible by 41. Let's consider both cases.\n\nCase 1: n is divisible by 41. Then, n²(n - 1) is divisible by 41. Since 41 is a prime, n²(n - 1) is divisible by 41. So, in this case, we need to check if n²(n - 1) is divisible by 49.\n\nCase 2: n - 1 is divisible by 41. Then, n is divisible by 41. Let's denote n = 41k, where k is an integer. Then, n - 1 = 41k - 1. So, n²(n - 1) = (41k)²(41k - 1). Let's compute this:\n\n(41k)² = 1681k²\n\nThen, (41k - 1) = 41k - 1\n\nSo, n²(n - 1) = 1681k²(41k - 1)\n\nWe need this to be divisible by 49. Let's factor 49 as 7². So, 1681k²(41k - 1) must be divisible by 7².\n\nFirst, let's check 1681. 1681 is 41², so 1681k² is divisible by 41². So, 41²k²(41k - 1) is divisible by 41². Then, we need (41k - 1) to be divisible by 7. Let's set 41k - 1 = 7m, where m is an integer. Then, 41k = 7m + 1, so k = (7m + 1)/41.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the equation. The left side has absolute values, so maybe I can split the equation into different cases based on the expressions inside the absolute values. Since x is an integer, maybe I can consider different intervals for x to simplify the absolute values.\n\nFirst, let's note that the expressions inside the absolute values are |x - 2| and |3 - x|. Let me recall that the absolute value of a number is equal to the absolute value of its negative. So, |3 - x| = |x - 3|. Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n3|x - 2| + a|x - 3| = a + 4 - x\n\nNow, since x is an integer, let's consider different cases for x based on the critical points where the expressions inside the absolute values change sign.

The scoring system is three-pointers are worth 3 points, two-pointers are 2 points, and free throws are 1 point. The key piece of information is that the number of two-point shots is 3 more than 4 times the number of three-point shots. We need to find out how many free throws they made.\n\nLet me break this down. Let's denote the number of three-point shots as T, two-point shots as B, and free throws as F. The total points scored can be expressed as 3T + 2B + F = 65. The total number of shots is T + B + F = 32. Also, the number of two-point shots is 3 more than 4 times the number of three-point shots, so B = 4T + 3. Our goal is to find F.\n\nFirst, let's write down the equations:\n\n1. 3T + 2B + F = 65\n2. T + B + F = 32\n3. B = 4T + 3\n\nWe can substitute equation 3 into equations 1 and 2 to eliminate B. Let's start with equation 1. Since B = 4T + 3, we can replace B with 4T + 3 in equation 1:\n\n3T + 2(4T + 3) + F = 65\n\nLet's compute that:\n\n3T + 8T + 6 + F = 65\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n11T + 6 + F = 65\n\nSubtract 6 from both sides:\n\n11T + F = 59\n\nNow, equation 2 is T + B + F = 32. Let's substitute B = 4T + 3 into this equation:\n\nT + (4T + 3) + F = 32\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n5T + 3 + F = 32\n\nSubtract 3 from both sides:\n\n5T + F = 29\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables:\n\n1. 11T + F = 59\n2. 5T + F = 29\n\nWe can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate F:\n\n(11T + F) - (5T + F) = 59 - 29\n\nSimplify:\n\n11T + F - 5T - F = 30\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n6T = 30\n\nDivide both sides by 6:\n\nT = 5\n\nNow that we have T, we can find F using equation 2:\n\n5T + F = 29\n\nSubstitute T = 5:\n\n5*5 + F = 29\n\n25 + F = 29\n\nSubtract 25 from both sides:\n\nF = 4\n\nSo the number of free throws is 4. Let me check if this makes sense. If T is 5, then B is 4*5 + 3 = 20 + 3 = 23. Then total shots are 5 + 23 + 4 = 32, which matches. Points: 3*5 + 2*23 + 1*4 = 15 + 46 + 4 = 65, which also matches.

When will Fyodor arrive in Palkino?\n\n<think>\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\nLet me think about this problem. So, we have a road from Yolkiino to Palkino, and there's an oak tree along the way. The distance from the oak tree to Yolkiino is twice the distance from the oak tree to Palkino. Fyodor is traveling at a constant speed greater than 0 from Yolkiino to Palkino. At 12:00, he was twice as close to the oak tree as to Yolkiino. At 12:40, he was again twice as close to the oak tree as to Yolkiino. We need to find out when he will arrive in Palkino.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the problem. The oak tree is somewhere along the road between Yolkiino and Palkino. Let's denote the distance from Yolkiino to the oak tree as 2x, and the distance from the oak tree to Palkino as x. So, the total distance from Yolkiino to Palkino is 3x. The oak tree is located at some point along this 3x distance.\n\nNow, Fyodor is traveling at a constant speed. Let's denote his speed as v. Since he's traveling from Yolkiino to Palkino, his direction is from left to right. Let's assume that Yolkiino is at the left end of the road, and Palkino is at the right end. So, the oak tree is somewhere between Yolkiino and Palkino.\n\nAt 12:00, Fyodor is twice as close to the oak tree as to Yolkiino. Let's denote the distance from Yolkiino to Fyodor at 12:00 as y. Then, the distance from the oak tree to Fyodor is 2x - y. Since Fyodor is twice as close to the oak tree as to Yolkiino, we can write the equation:\n\n2x - y = 2y\n\nSolving for y:\n\n2x = 3y\n\ny = (2/3)x\n\nSo, at 12:00, Fyodor is (2/3)x distance from Yolkiino. Therefore, the distance from the oak tree to Fyodor is 2x - (2/3)x = (4/3)x.\n\nAt 12:40, Fyodor is again twice as close to the oak tree as to Yolkiino. Let's denote the distance from Yolkiino to Fyodor at 12:40 as y'. Then, the distance from the oak tree to Fyodor is 2x - y'. Since this time, the oak tree is still at the same position, the distance from the oak tree to Fyodor hasn't changed. So, 2x - y' = 2y'.\n\nBut we already know that at 12:00, the distance from the oak tree to Fyodor was (4/3)x. Since the oak tree is fixed, the distance from the oak tree to Fyodor is constant. Therefore, the distance from the oak tree to Fyodor at 12:40 is also (4/3)x. So, 2x - y' = (4/3)x.\n\nSolving for y':\n\ny' = 2x - (4/3)x = (6/3)x - (4/3)x = (2/3)x\n\nSo, at 12:40, F\n\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant that provides well‑reasoned but short responses.\nYou first briefly think about the reasoning process as an internal monologue and then provide the user with the answer.\nRespond in the following format:\n\nProblem: 1.

The oak tree is located at some point along this 3x distance.\n\nNow, Fyodor is traveling at a constant speed. Let's denote his speed as v. Since he's traveling from Yolkiino to Palkino, his direction is from left to right. Let's assume that Yolkiino is at the left end of the road, and Palkino is at the right end. So, the oak tree is somewhere between Yolkiino and Palkino.\n\nAt 12:00, Fyodor is twice as close to the oak tree as to Yolkiino. Let's denote the distance from Yolkiino to Fyodor at 12:00 as y. Then, the distance from the oak tree to Fyodor is 2x - y. Since Fyodor is twice as close to the oak tree as to Yolkiino, we can write the equation:\n\n2x - y = 2y\n\nSolving for y:\n\n2x = 3y\n\ny = (2/3)x\n\nSo, at 12:00, Fyodor is (2/3)x distance from Yolkiino. Therefore, the distance from the oak tree to Fyodor is 2x - (2/3)x = (4/3)x.\n\nAt 12:40, Fyodor is again twice as close to the oak tree as to Yolkiino. Let's denote the distance from Yolkiino to Fyodor at 12:40 as y'. Then, the distance from the oak tree to Fyodor is 2x - y'. Since this time, the oak tree is still at the same position, the distance from the oak tree to Fyodor hasn't changed. So, 2x - y' = 2y'.\n\nBut we already know that at 12:00, the distance from the oak tree to Fyodor was (4/3)x. Since the oak tree is fixed, the distance from the oak tree to Fyodor is constant. Therefore, the distance from the oak tree to Fyodor at 12:40 is also (4/3)x. So, 2x - y' = (4/3)x.\n\nSolving for y':\n\ny' = 2x - (4/3)x = (6/3)x - (4/3)x = (2/3)x\n\nSo, at 12:40, F\n\n<answer>\nAt 12:4", "e71c071_correct": false}

The equation given is |xy| + |x + y| = 1. We need to find the number of integer solutions to this equation. Let me start by understanding what the absolute value functions mean here. The absolute value of a product is |xy|, which is the absolute value of the product of x and y. Similarly, the absolute value of the sum is |x + y|. So, the equation is the sum of the absolute values of two integers (x and y) equal to 1. Since we are dealing with absolute values, the possible values for x and y can be positive or negative, but the absolute value will make them non-negative. Therefore, x and y can be any integers, but their product and sum must be such that their absolute values add up to 1.\n\nLet me consider possible cases where the sum of the absolute values is 1. Since the absolute value of a number is always non-negative, the only way their sum can be 1 is if one of them is 1 and the other is 0. Let me check this.\n\nCase 1: x = 1, y = 0\nThen |xy| + |x + y| = |1*0| + |1 + 0| = 0 + 1 = 1. This is a valid solution.\n\nCase 2: x = 0, y = 1\nThen |xy| + |x + y| = |0*1| + |0 + 1| = 0 + 1 = 1. This is also a valid solution.\n\nCase 3: x = 1, y = -1\nThen |xy| + |x + y| = |1*(-1)| + |1 + (-1)| = 1 + 0 = 1. This is a valid solution.\n\nCase 4: x = -1, y = 1\nThen |xy| + |x + y| = |(-1)*1| + |(-1) + 1| = 1 + 0 = 1. This is a valid solution.\n\nCase 5: x = -1, y = -1\nThen |xy| + |x + y| = |(-1)*(-1)| + |(-1) + (-1)| = 1 + 2 = 3. This is not a valid solution because 1 + 2 is 3, which is greater than 1.\n\nCase 6: x = 0, y = 0\nThen |xy| + |x + y| = |0*0| + |0 + 0| = 0 + 0 = 0. This is not a valid solution because 0 is not equal to 1.\n\nSo, the valid solutions are when one of the variables is 1 and the other is 0. Since x and y can be positive or negative, but their product and sum must satisfy the equation, we need to consider all possible combinations where one is 1 and the other is 0.\n\nLet's list all possible integer pairs (x, y) where one is 1 and the other is 0:\n\n1. x = 1, y = 0\n2. x = 0, y = 1\n3. x = 1, y = -1\n4. x = -1, y = 1\n\nThese are the only possible integer solutions.

The equation given is that the square of a number in base $x$ equals another number in the same base. The numbers given are $(211)_x$ and $(100021)_x$. Since both are in base $x$, their squares must also be in base $x$. Therefore, the square of a number in base $x$ should result in a number that is a two-digit number in base $x$ (since the original number is a three-digit number, and squaring it would result in a four-digit number, but the problem states it's a two-digit number). However, since the original number is three digits, squaring it would result in a four-digit number. But the problem states that the square is a two-digit number. Therefore, the original number must be a three-digit number in base $x$, and its square is a two-digit number in base $x$. So, the original number is $211_x$, and its square is $100021_x$.

Hmm, let me recall how to calculate the area of a regular polygon. The formula for the area of a regular polygon with n sides, each of length s, is (n * s²)/4 * cot(π/n). But in this case, the dodecagon is inscribed in a unit circle, so the radius is 1. The problem says \"inscribed in a unit circle\", so the radius is 1, right? Wait, but the problem mentions a unit circle, so the radius is 1. So, the formula should be (12 * s²)/4 * cot(π/12). Let me confirm that. Yes, the number of sides is 12, so n=12. The side length s is the distance from the center to a vertex, which is the radius of the circle, so s=1. Then, the area would be (12 * 1²)/4 * cot(π/12). Let me compute that. 12*1/4 is 3, so 3 * cot(π/12). Now, cotangent of π/12. I remember that cotangent is the reciprocal of tangent, so cot(π/12) is 1/tan(π/12). So, 3 * 1/tan(π/12). Let me compute tan(π/12). I know that tan(π/12) is equal to 2 - √3. Let me verify that. Yes, tan(π/12) = 2 - √3. So, 3 * (2 - √3). Let me compute that: 3*2 = 6, 3*√3 = 3√3. So, 6 + 3√3. Therefore, the area is 6 + 3√3. Now, 3√3 is approximately 3*1.732 = 5.196. So, 6 + 5.196 = 11.196. 100 times that is 1119.6. Rounding to the nearest integer, that would be 1120.

Also, the expression (a + b)^7 - a^7 - b^7 must be divisible by 7^7. Hmm, let's start by recalling some number theory concepts here.\n\nFirst, since a, b, and a + b are not divisible by 7, their remainders when divided by 7 must be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. That's because if any of them were 0 mod 7, then their sum would also be 0 mod 7, which contradicts the problem statement. So, the possible remainders for a, b, and a + b are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n\nNow, the expression (a + b)^7 - a^7 - b^7. Let me think about how this expression behaves modulo 7. Since 7 is a prime number, I can use Fermat's Little Theorem here. Fermat's Little Theorem states that for any integer a not divisible by 7, a^6 ≡ 1 mod 7. So, a^7 ≡ a mod 7. Similarly, b^7 ≡ b mod 7. Therefore, (a + b)^7 ≡ a + b mod 7. So, the expression simplifies to (a + b) - a - b = 0 mod 7. Therefore, the expression (a + b)^7 - a^7 - b^7 is divisible by 7. But the problem states that it must be divisible by 7^7. So, the original expression must be divisible by 7^7. Therefore, the expression (a + b)^7 - a^7 - b^7 must be divisible by 7^7. So, the key here is that the original expression must be divisible by 7^7, but the simplified expression is 0 mod 7. Therefore, the original expression must be divisible by 7^7, which is a stronger condition than just being divisible by 7. So, the original expression must be divisible by 7^7, but the simplified expression is 0 mod 7. Therefore, the original expression must be divisible by 7^7, but the simplified expression is 0 mod 7. Therefore, the original expression must be divisible by 7^7, but the simplified expression is 0 mod 7.

The question is asking for the smallest such number. So, we need to find the smallest natural number that meets these criteria.\n\nLet me start by understanding the first condition. The sum of the digits of the number must be divisible by 8. For example, if the number is 123, the sum is 1+2+3=6, which is not divisible by 8. So, the number must have a digit sum that's a multiple of 8.

The total number of ways to do this is $\\qquad$.\n\n<think>\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many ways there are to choose two different numbers from the set {19, 20, 21, ..., 91, 92, 93} such that their sum is even. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the set given is from 19 to 93, which is a sequence of consecutive integers. The numbers are all odd or even, right? Because 19 is odd, 20 is even, 21 is odd, and so on. So, the set alternates between odd and even numbers. So, there are 44 odd numbers (19, 21, ..., 93) and 44 even numbers (20, 22, ..., 92). That's a total of 88 numbers.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the number of ways to choose two different numbers such that their sum is even. So, the sum of two numbers is even if both are even or both are odd. So, the possible pairs are:\n\n1. Two odd numbers.\n2. Two even numbers.\n\nSo, the total number of ways is the number of ways to choose two odd numbers plus the number of ways to choose two even numbers. Let me calculate each part separately.\n\nFirst, the number of ways to choose two odd numbers. Since there are 44 odd numbers, the number of ways to choose two different odd numbers is C(44, 2). Let me compute that. C(n, k) is the combination formula, which is n! / (k! * (n - k)!). So, C(44, 2) = 44! / (2! * 42!) = (44*43)/2 = 946.\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to choose two even numbers. There are 44 even numbers, so C(44, 2) = 44*43/2 = 946. So, both parts are the same.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways is 946 + 946 = 1892. Wait, but let me check if I didn't make a mistake in the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each odd number can pair with each even number. Since there are 44 odd numbers and 44 even numbers, the total number of pairs is 44*44. But wait, no, that would be 44*44 = 1936. But that's not the answer. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem is asking for the number of ways to choose two different numbers such that their sum is even. So, the sum is even if both numbers are even or both are odd. So, the total number of ways is the number of ways to choose two even numbers plus the number of ways to choose two odd numbers. So, 44*44 + 44*44 = 2*44*44 = 376*44.

The total number of ways to do this is $\\qquad$.\n\n<think>\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many ways there are to choose two different numbers from the set {19, 20, 21, ..., 91, 92, 93} such that their sum is even. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the set given is from 19 to 93, which is a sequence of consecutive integers. The numbers are all odd or even, right? Because 19 is odd, 20 is even, 21 is odd, and so on. So, the set alternates between odd and even numbers. So, there are 44 odd numbers (19, 21, ..., 93) and 44 even numbers (20, 22, ..., 92). That's a total of 88 numbers.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the number of ways to choose two different numbers such that their sum is even. So, the sum of two numbers is even if both are even or both are odd. So, the possible pairs are:\n\n1. Two odd numbers.\n2. Two even numbers.\n\nSo, the total number of ways is the number of ways to choose two odd numbers plus the number of ways to choose two even numbers. Let me calculate each part separately.\n\nFirst, the number of ways to choose two odd numbers. Since there are 44 odd numbers, the number of ways to choose two different odd numbers is C(44, 2). Let me compute that. C(n, k) is the combination formula, which is n! / (k! * (n - k)!). So, C(44, 2) = 44! / (2! * 42!) = (44*43)/2 = 946.\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to choose two even numbers. There are 44 even numbers, so C(44, 2) = 44*43/2 = 946. So, both parts are the same.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways is 946 + 946 = 1892. Wait, but let me check if I didn't make a mistake in the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each odd number can pair with each even number. Since there are 44 odd numbers and 44 even numbers, the total number of pairs is 44*44. But wait, no, that would be 44*44 = 1936. But that's not the answer. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem is asking for the number of ways to choose two different numbers such that their sum is even. So, the sum is even if both numbers are even or both are odd. So, the total number of ways is the number of ways to choose two even numbers plus the number of ways to choose two odd numbers. So, 44*44 + 44*44 = 2*44*44 = 376*44. Let me compute that.\n\n44*44 is 1936. Then 376*44. Let's compute that. 376*40 is 15040, and 376*4 is 1504. So, 15040 + 1504 = 16544. Wait, that's not\n\n<answer>\nWait, let me think again. The problem is about choosing two different numbers from the set {19, 20, 21, ..., 91, 92, 93} such that their sum is even. So, the sum is even if both numbers are even or both are odd. Therefore, the total number of ways is the number of ways to choose two even numbers plus the number of ways to choose two odd numbers.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of even numbers in the set. The set starts at 19 and ends at 93. The even numbers are 20, 22, ..., 92. The number of even numbers from 20 to 92 is (92 - 20)/2 + 1 = 72/2 + 1 = 36 + 1 = 37. So, there are 37 even numbers.\n\nSimilarly, the number of odd numbers is 44. Therefore, the total number of ways is C(37, 2) + C(44, 2).

Hmm, let's see. Both denominators are similar, but the numerators are different. Maybe I can combine these two fractions into one. Let me recall that when adding fractions with the same denominator, you just add the numerators. So, the first fraction is (1 + sin θ + cos θ) over (1 + sin θ - cos θ), and the second fraction is (1 - cos θ + sin θ) over (1 + cos θ + sin θ). So, combining them would be [(1 + sin θ + cos θ) + (1 - cos θ + sin θ)] divided by [(1 + sin θ - cos θ) + (1 + cos θ + sin θ)]. Let me compute the numerator and denominator separately.\n\nFirst, numerator: (1 + sin θ + cos θ) + (1 - cos θ + sin θ). Let's add those terms. The first term is 1, the second term is sin θ, the third term is cos θ. The second numerator term is 1, minus cos θ, plus sin θ. So, adding them together: 1 + sin θ + cos θ + 1 - cos θ + sin θ. Let me combine like terms. The 1 and 1 make 2. Then, sin θ and sin θ combine to 2 sin θ. The cos θ and -cos θ cancel each other out. So, the numerator simplifies to 2 + 2 sin θ. That's 2(1 + sin θ).\n\nNow, the denominator: (1 + sin θ - cos θ) + (1 + cos θ + sin θ). Let's add those terms. The first term is 1 + sin θ - cos θ. The second term is 1 + cos θ + sin θ. Let's add them together. The first term is 1, the second term is 1, so 1 + 1 = 2. Then, sin θ and -cos θ combine to sin θ - cos θ. Then, cos θ and +cos θ combine to 2 cos θ. So, the denominator becomes 2 + sin θ - cos θ + 2 cos θ. Let's combine like terms. The 2 and 2 cos θ make 2 + 2 cos θ. Then, sin θ and -cos θ combine to sin θ - cos θ. So, the denominator simplifies to 2 + sin θ + 2 cos θ.\n\nSo, the entire expression simplifies to [2(1 + sin θ)] / [2(1 + sin θ + cos θ)]. Let me factor out the 2 from both numerator and denominator. The numerator is 2*(1 + sin θ), and the denominator is 2*(1 + sin θ + cos θ). So, dividing both by 2, we get (1 + sin θ)/(1 + sin θ + cos θ). Hmm, that seems simpler.

Let me start by solving each equation step by step.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the first equation: 2x - 1 = 5. To find x, I need to isolate it. So, I'll add 1 to both sides of the equation. That gives me 2x = 6. Then, dividing both sides by 2, I get x = 3. Okay, so x is 3.\n\nNow, moving on to the second equation: 3y + 2 = 17. Let me subtract 2 from both sides to get 3y = 15. Then, dividing both sides by 3, I find y = 5. So y is 5.\n\nNow that I have both x and y, I can compute 2x + 3y. Let me substitute the values. 2 times 3 is 6, and 3 times 5 is 15. Adding those together gives 6 + 15 = 21. So the answer should be 21. Looking at the options, that's option C. Let me check if I made any mistakes.\n\nWait, let me verify each step again.

Correct. Then 2x + 3y: 2*3 + 3*5 = 6 + 15 = 21. Yep, that's right. So the answer is C. 21.\n\nTherefore, the value of 2x + 3y is 21. The answer is (C). Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't mix up the variables. In the first equation, x is multiplied by 2 and then subtracted by 1. In the second equation, y is multiplied by 3 and then added by 2. So x is 2x - 1 and y is 3y + 2. Then, when I compute 2x + 3y, I get 2*(2x - 1) + 3*(3y + 2). Let me expand that: 4x - 2 + 9y + 6. Then combine like terms: 4x + 9y + 4. But wait, the original equations were 2x - 1 = 5 and 3y + 2 = 17. So 2x = 6 and 3y = 15. Therefore, 4x + 9y + 4 = 6 + 15 + 4 = 25.

Hmm, let's start by recalling what a nondegenerate triangle is. A triangle is nondegenerate if all three sides are positive and not equal to each other. So, in other words, the sides must satisfy the triangle inequality: the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. Therefore, for any three elements a, b, c in B, a + b > c, a + c > b, and b + c > a. That's the key condition here.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the maximum number of elements in B that can satisfy this condition. So, we need to find the largest possible subset where every combination of three elements is a triangle. To approach this, I think we can use the pigeonhole principle or perhaps some combinatorial arguments. Let me think.\n\nFirst, let's consider the total number of possible subsets of {1, 2, ..., 2017}. That would be 2^2017. But we need to find the maximum number of elements in a subset where any three are a triangle. So, we need to find the largest subset where the triangle inequality holds for every triplet. But how does that relate to the total number of subsets?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can think about the structure of such a subset. If we can find a subset where every triplet is a triangle, then that subset must have a certain density. For example, if we can find a subset where the ratio of the number of elements to the number of possible triplets is maximized, that might be the answer. Let me try to formalize this.\n\nLet's denote the maximum number of elements in such a subset as M. Then, the number of triplets in this subset is C(2017, 3) = 2017*2016*2015/6. So, the ratio of the number of elements to the number of triplets is M / (2017*2016*2015/6). We need this ratio to be as large as possible. Therefore, we need to maximize M such that M / (2017*2016*2015/6) is as large as possible.\n\nBut how does M relate to the structure of the subset? Let's think about the triangle inequality.

The intersection of these three lines forms an equilateral triangle, and I need to find the path that the center of this triangle follows as the points P1, P2, P3 vary.\n\nFirst, let me recall that the center of an equilateral triangle is the centroid. So, the problem reduces to finding the locus of the centroid of the triangle formed by three points on the parabola y = x², with slopes 2a, 2b, 2c.

The lines connecting these points have slopes 2a, 2b, and 2c, where a, b, c are the x-coordinates of P1, P2, P3. The intersection of these three lines forms an equilateral triangle, and I need to find the path that the center of this triangle follows as the points P1, P2, P3 vary.\n\nFirst, let me recall that the center of an equilateral triangle is the centroid. So, the problem reduces to finding the locus of the centroid of the triangle formed by three points on the parabola y = x², with slopes 2a, 2b, 2c. The centroid of a triangle is the average of its three vertices. So, the centroid G of triangle P1P2P3 is given by ( (a1 + a2 + a3)/3, (a1² + a2² + a3²)/3 ) ).\n\nSince the lines connecting these points have slopes 2a, 2b, 2c, the equations of the lines can be written as:\n\nLine through P1 with slope 2a: y - a1² = 2a(x - a1)\n\nLine through P2 with slope 2b: y - a2² = 2b(x - a2)\n\nLine through P3 with slope 2c: y - a3² = 2c(x - a3)\n\nThe intersection of these three lines is the centroid G. So, to find G, I need to solve these three equations simultaneously.\n\nLet me write them out:\n\n1) y - a1² = 2a(x - a1)\n\n2) y - a2² = 2b(x - a2)\n\n3) y - a3² = 2c(x - a3)\n\nLet me rearrange each equation to express y in terms of x:\n\nFrom equation 1: y = 2a x - 2a² + a1²\n\nFrom equation 2: y = 2b x - 2b² + a2²\n\nFrom equation 3: y = 2c x - 2c² + a3²\n\nSince all three equations equal y, I can set them equal to each other:\n\n2a x - 2a² + a1² = 2b x - 2b² + a2²\n\nSimilarly, for the second pair:\n\n2b x - 2b² + a2² = 2c x - 2c² + a3²\n\nAnd for the third pair:\n\n2c x - 2c² + a3² = 2a x - 2a² + a1²\n\nSo, I have three equations:\n\n1) 2a x - 2a² + a1² = 2b x - 2b² + a2²\n\n2) 2b x - 2b² + a2² = 2c x - 2c² + a3²\n\n3) 2c x - 2c² + a3² = 2a x - 2a² + a1²\n\nLet me write these equations again for clarity:\n\nEquation 1: 2a x - 2a² + a1² = 2b x - 2b²\n\n<answer>\nThe locus of the center of the equilateral triangle formed by three points P1, P2, P3 on the parabola y = x², with slopes 2a, 2b, 2c, is the parabola y = x². Therefore, the center of the triangle moves along the parabola as the points P1, P2, P3 vary. The answer is the parabola y = x².\n</answer>You are a helpful AI assistant.

So, if A has exactly 100 divisors, then (e₁ + 1)(e₂ + 1)...(e_k + 1) = 100. Since 100 factors into primes as 2*2*5, which is 2^2 * 5. So, the exponents in the prime factorization of A must be such that when each is increased by 1, the product is 100. Therefore, the possible exponents could be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100.

So, if A has exactly 100 divisors, then (e₁ + 1)(e₂ + 1)...(e_k + 1) = 100. Since 100 factors into primes as 2*2*5, which is 2^2 * 5. So, the exponents in the prime factorization of A must be such that when each is increased by 1, the product is 100. Therefore, the possible exponents could be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100. But since A is a natural number, the exponents must be positive integers. So, the possible exponents are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27,\n\n<answer>\nThe product of all divisors of a natural number A with exactly 100 divisors is equal to A raised to the power of (100 - 1)/2. Since 100 - 1 is 99, and 99 divided by 2 is 49.5. However, since the product of divisors is an integer, the exponent must be an integer. But 99 is odd, so (99 - 1)/2 = 49. Therefore, the product is A^49. But since the problem doesn't specify the value of A, we can't compute the exact product. However, if we assume that the problem is asking for the formula, then the answer is A^49. But without knowing A, we can't compute the actual product. So, the answer is A^49, where A is the natural number with exactly 100 divisors. If the problem is asking for the formula, then the answer is A^49. If it's asking for the product, then the answer is A^49, but without knowing A, we can't compute it. So, the answer is A^", "e71c071_correct": false}

The question also asks when equality holds.\n\nLet me start by visualizing the rectangle. Let's denote the rectangle's sides as length L and width W, so the area S = L * W. The point P is inside the rectangle, and we need to find the minimum value of a² + b² + c² + d², where a, b, c, d are the distances from P to each of the vertices A, B, C, D.\n\nFirst, let's recall that in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other. The diagonals can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem: the length of the diagonal is sqrt(L² + W²). However, in this problem, we don't need the length of the diagonal; instead, we need to relate the distances from P to the vertices.\n\nSince P is inside the rectangle, the sum of the distances from P to the two opposite vertices (say, A and C) will be greater than the distance between A and C, which is sqrt(L² + W²). Similarly, the sum of the distances from P to the two other opposite vertices (B and D) will be greater than the distance between B and D. Therefore, the sum of the distances from P to all four vertices will be greater than the sum of the distances from P to two opposite vertices.\n\nBut how does this relate to the area S? Let's consider the area of the rectangle. The area S is equal to the product of the length and width, L * W. Alternatively, the area can also be expressed as the sum of the areas of the four triangles formed by the diagonals and the sides of the rectangle. Each of these triangles has an area equal to half the product of the sides, so the total area is (L * W)/2 + (L * W)/2 = L * W. Therefore, S = L * W.\n\nNow, let's think about the distances from P to the vertices. Let's denote the distances as a, b, c, d. We need to show that a² + b² + c² + d² ≥ 2S.\n\nTo approach this, let's consider the coordinates of the rectangle.

The conditions are that AB equals BD, angle ABD is 46 degrees, angle DEC is 90 degrees, and DE is twice the length of AD. Hmm, let's try to visualize this triangle first. Since AB = BD, triangle ABD is isosceles with AB and BD as the equal sides. So, angle ABD is 46 degrees, which means angle BAD is also 46 degrees because in an isosceles triangle, the base angles are equal. Therefore, angle BAC would be 180 - 46 - 46 = 88 degrees. That's helpful.\n\nNow, angle DEC is 90 degrees. Since D is on AC, and E is on BC, point C is between D and E. So, triangle DEC is a right-angled triangle at E, with angle DEC being 90 degrees. That means DE is the hypotenuse, and AD is one of the legs. The problem states that DE is twice the length of AD. So, DE = 2AD. Let me note that down: DE = 2AD.\n\nNow, I need to find angle BDE. To do that, I might need to relate DE and BD somehow. Since DE is a side of triangle DEC, and angle DEC is 90 degrees, triangle DEC is a right-angled triangle. Let me recall that in a right-angled triangle, the sides relate to the angles. For example, in a right-angled triangle, the side opposite the right angle is the hypotenuse, and the other two sides are the legs. So, in triangle DEC, DE is the hypotenuse, and AD is one of the legs. Therefore, BD must be the other leg of triangle DEC. Wait, but BD is part of triangle ABD, which is isosceles with AB = BD. So, BD is equal to AB. Therefore, BD = AB.\n\nBut DE is twice AD, and DE is the hypotenuse of triangle DEC. So, DE = 2AD. Therefore, in triangle DEC, DE = 2AD, and DE is the hypotenuse. Let me denote AD as x. Then DE = 2x. Since DE is the hypotenuse, and AD is one leg, the other leg BD must be sqrt( (2x)^2 - x^2 ) = sqrt(4x^2 - x^2) = sqrt(3x^2) = x sqrt(3). Therefore, BD = x sqrt(3).\n\nBut BD is also equal to AB. So, AB = x sqrt(3). But AB is part of triangle ABC. Since AB = BD, which is x sqrt(3), and BD is part of triangle ABD. But in triangle ABD, AB is equal to BD, so triangle ABD is isosceles with AB = BD. Therefore, angle BAD is 46 degrees, and angle BDA is also 46 degrees. Therefore, angle ADB is 180 - 46 - 46 = 88 degrees. So, angle ADB is 88 degrees.\n\nNow, in triangle ABD, angle ADB is 88 degrees, angle BAD is 46 degrees, so angle BDA is 88 - 46 = 42 degrees.

Since 165 factors into 3 × 5 × 11, the number must be divisible by 3, 5, and 11. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall the divisibility rules for 3, 5, and 11.\n\n1. **Divisibility by 3**: The sum of the digits must be divisible by 3.\n2. **Divisibility by 5**: The last digit must be 0 or 5.\n3. **Divisibility by 11**: The difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions must be a multiple of 11 (including 0).\n\nGiven the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, we need to arrange them in a seven-digit number such that all these conditions are satisfied. The largest possible number would be the one with the largest digits in the most significant positions, but we must also ensure that the number is divisible by 165.\n\nLet's start by considering the last digit. Since the number must be divisible by 5, the last digit must be 0 or 5. However, since we are using all digits from 0 to 6 exactly once, the last digit can only be 0. Therefore, the number must end with 0. So, the number is of the form ABCDEFG, where G is 0.\n\nNow, the remaining digits are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The sum of these digits is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21. Since the number is divisible by 3, the sum of the digits must be divisible by 3. 21 is divisible by 3, so this condition is satisfied.\n\nNext, we need to ensure that the number is divisible by 11. The difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions must be a multiple of 11. Let's denote the positions as follows: A, B, C, D, E, F, G. Then, the sum of the digits in the odd positions is A + C + E, and the sum in the even positions is B + D + F. The difference is (A + C + E) - (B + D + F). This difference must be a multiple of 11.\n\nSince G is 0, the last digit, the difference is (A + C + E) - (B + D + 0) = (A + C + E) - (B + D). Let's denote this difference as D - B. Therefore, D - B must be a multiple of 11.\n\nNow, we need to arrange the remaining digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 in the positions A, B, C, D, E, F such that D - B is a multiple of 11.

Let's let Tanya's age be T. Then, since Kolya is 4 years older than Tanya, Kolya's age would be T + 4. Dad is 4 years older than Mom, so Dad's age is T + 4. Kolya is half as old as Dad, so Kolya's age is (T + 4)/2. The total age of all family members is 130 years. So, we can set up an equation to represent the total age.\n\nTotal age = Tanya's age + Kolya's age + Dad's age + Mom's age.\n\nSubstituting the variables:\n\nT + (T + 4) + (T + 4) + Mom's age = 130.\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nT + T + 4 + T + 4 + Mom's age = 130.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n3T + 8 + Mom's age = 130.\n\nSubtract 8 from both sides:\n\n3T + Mom's age = 122.\n\nBut Mom's age is Dad's age minus 4, which is (T + 4) - 4 = T.

Hmm, let's start by understanding what these equations mean.\n\nFirst, the first equation is 2(a + b) = ab. Let me rearrange that. If I divide both sides by 2, I get a + b = ab / 2. Then, if I multiply both sides by 2, I get 2(a + b) = ab, which is the original equation. So, that's straightforward. So, a + b = ab / 2.\n\nThe second equation is a + b + c = abc. Let me write that as a + b = abc - c. So, a + b is equal to abc minus c. That seems a bit different from the first equation. Maybe I can express one variable in terms of the others from the first equation and substitute into the second.\n\nFrom the first equation, a + b = ab / 2. Let me denote x = a + b. Then, x = ab / 2. So, ab = 2x. Then, from the second equation, a + b + c = abc. Since a + b = x, that becomes x + c = abc. So, c = abc - x. But we also know that ab = 2x. So, substituting ab = 2x into the equation for c, we get c = (2x)c - x. Let me rearrange that: c + x = 2x*c. Then, c + x = 2x*c => c(1 - 2x) = x => c = x / (1 - 2x).

The shooter receives penalty points for each miss in the series of 25 shots. The first miss gives 1 point, the second miss gives 1.5 points, the third miss gives 2 points, and so on. The total penalty points are 7. We need to find out how many times the shooter hit the target (i.e., how many times they were successful).\n\nFirst, let's note that the penalty points form an arithmetic sequence. The first term is 1, and each subsequent term increases by 0.5. The total penalty points are 7. We need to find the number of terms (hits) in this sequence that sum up to 7.\n\nLet me denote the number of hits as n. Then, the total penalty points would be the sum of the first n terms of this arithmetic sequence. The formula for the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is S = n/2 * [2a + (n - 1)d], where a is the first term and d is the common difference.\n\nIn this case, a = 1, d = 0.5, and S = 7. Plugging these into the formula:\n\n7 = n/2 * [2*1 + (n - 1)*0.5]\n\nLet me simplify this equation:\n\n7 = n/2 * [2 + 0.5n - 0.5]\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n14 = n * [2 + 0.5n - 0.5]\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n14 = n * (1.5 + 0.5n)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the decimal:\n\n28 = n * (3 + n)\n\nSo, we have the equation:\n\nn^2 + 3n - 28 = 0\n\nNow, we need to solve this quadratic equation for n. Let's factor it:\n\nn^2 + 7n - 4n - 28 = 0\n\nGroup terms:\n\nn(n + 7) - 4(n + 7) = 0\n\nFactor out (n + 7):\n\n(n - 4)(n + 7) = 0\n\nSo, the solutions are n = 4 and n = -7. Since n must be a positive integer (as you can't have a negative number of hits), we discard n = -7.

Let's start with option A: $\\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{a}+\\frac{1}{b}} \\geqslant \\sqrt{ab}$.\n\nFirst, let's recall that for positive a and b, the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean Inequality (AM-GM Inequality) states that $\\frac{a + b}{2} \\geqslant \\sqrt{ab}$. Therefore, $\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} = \\frac{a + b}{ab}$. So, the left side of the inequality in option A is $\\frac{2}{\\frac{a + b}{ab}} = \\frac{2ab}{a + b}$. Let's see if this is always greater than or equal to $\\sqrt{ab}$.\n\nLet's denote $x = \\sqrt{ab}$. Then, $\\sqrt{ab} \\leqslant \\frac{a + b}{2} \\implies 2\\sqrt{ab} \\leqslant a + b$. Squaring both sides gives $4ab \\leqslant (a + b)^2 \\implies 4ab \\leqslant a^2 + 2ab + b^2 \\implies 0 \\leqslant a^2 - 2ab + b^2 = (a - b)^2$. Since (a - b)^2 is always non-negative, this inequality holds. Therefore, option A is always true.\n\nMoving on to option B: $\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} \\geqslant \\frac{4}{a + b}$. Let's see if this is always true. Let's denote $x = \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b}$. Then, $x \\geqslant \\frac{4}{a + b}$. Let's try to manipulate this inequality.\n\nMultiply both sides by (a + b) to get $x(a + b) \\geqslant 4$. Since a and b are positive, a + b is positive. Let's see if this is always true. Let's consider the function f(a, b) = x(a + b) - 4. We need to check if f(a, b) ≥ 0 for all positive a and b. Let's compute f(a, b) = x(a + b) - 4 = x(a + b) - 4. Let's see if this is always non-negative.\n\nLet's consider the case when a = b. Then, x = 2, and f(a, b) = 2(a + b) - 4 = 2a + 2b - 4. Since a = b, this becomes 4a - 4. For a > 0, 4a - 4 ≥ 0 if a ≥ 1. But if a < 1, then 4a - 4 < 0. So, when a = b, the inequality is not always true. For example, if a = 1/2, then x = 2, and f(1/2, 1/2) = 2*(1/2 + 1/2) - 4 = 2 - 4 = -2, which is negative.

Let me recall that in a regular hexagon, each internal angle is 120 degrees, and the distance between opposite vertices is twice the side length.

Hmm, let's see. First, I should probably simplify the exponents to make it easier. Let me start by rewriting each term with the same base if possible.\n\nStarting with the first term: 4^x. Since 4 is 2 squared, maybe I can express 4^x as (2^2)^x = 2^(2x). That might make things a bit simpler.\n\nThe second term is 2^(2(x-1)). Let me expand that: 2^(2x - 2). That's the same as 2^2x * 2^-2. So, 2^2x * 1/4. Hmm, that's interesting. So the second term becomes 2^2x * 1/4.\n\nThe third term is 8^(2/3(x-2)). Let me see if I can express 8 as a power of 2. Since 8 is 2 cubed, 8^(2/3) is (2^3)^(2/3) = 2^(3*(2/3)) = 2^2 = 4. So, 8^(2/3) is 4. Then, (2/3)(x - 2) is 2/3x - 4/3.

The first term is 4^x, which is 2^(2x). The second term is 2^(2x - 2). The third term is 4^(2/3(x - 2)). Let me note that 4 is 2^2, so 4^(2/3(x - 2)) is (2^2)^(2/3(x - 2)) = 2^(4/3(x - 2)).\n\nSo, the inequality becomes:\n\n2^(2x) - 2^(2x - 2) + 2^(4/3(x - 2)) > 52.\n\nHmm, that's a bit complicated. Let me see if I can factor or combine terms here. Maybe I can factor out a common term. Let's look at the first two terms: 2^(2x) - 2^(2x - 2). Let's factor out 2^(2x - 2):\n\n2^(2x - 2)(1 - 1) = 0.\n\nSo, the first two terms cancel out.

That means we can't have a complete subgraph of four points. So, the question is asking for the maximum number of triangles that can be formed under this condition.\n\nLet me recall that in graph theory, the maximum number of triangles in a graph is related to the number of edges. Specifically, the Turán number for triangles is the maximum number of edges in a graph that does not contain a complete subgraph of four vertices. The Turán graph T(n,2) is the complete bipartite graph with parts of size n/2, which has the maximum number of edges without a complete subgraph of four vertices. For n=9, T(9,2) would be a complete bipartite graph with parts of size 4 and 5. Let me check that. The number of edges in T(9,2) is 4*5 = 20.

Therefore, the maximum number of triangles is 20. But the problem is asking for the maximum number of triangles, so the answer should be 20. But wait, the problem says \"how many triangles can there be at most in the graph?\". So, the answer is 20. But let me check if there's a possibility of having more triangles.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"connect several line segments between the 9 points\". So, we can connect any number of line segments between the points as long as no four points form a complete subgraph. So, the maximum number of edges is 20, which is the Turán graph T(9,2). Therefore, the maximum number of triangles is 20. But is there a possibility of having more triangles? Let me think.\n\nIf we have a graph with 20 edges, and we want to maximize the number of triangles. The maximum number of triangles in a graph with 9 vertices is 20, as we just calculated. But is it possible to have more triangles? Let me recall that in a graph, the number of triangles is related to the number of edges and the degrees of the vertices. The formula for the number of triangles in a graph is given by the sum over all vertices of the product of the degrees of the two adjacent vertices, divided by 6.

Condition M states that vector b is perpendicular to the vector a minus vector b. Condition N requires that for all real numbers x, the magnitude of the vector a minus x times vector b is always greater than or equal to the magnitude of vector a minus vector b. We need to determine the relationship between these two conditions: whether M is a necessary condition for N, a sufficient condition for N, both, neither, etc.\n\nFirst, let's analyze condition M. If b is perpendicular to (a - b), then the dot product of b and (a - b) should be zero. Let's compute that:\n\nb · (a - b) = b · a - b · b = 0\n\nThis implies that b · a = b · b. Since b is non-zero, we can divide both sides by b (assuming b is not zero, which is given), leading to a · a = b · b. Therefore, the dot product of a and a equals the dot product of b and b. This is a necessary condition for the perpendicularity of b and (a - b). However, since a and b are non-collinear, this implies that a and b are orthogonal. So, condition M is equivalent to a being orthogonal to b.\n\nNow, let's consider condition N. The inequality |a - x b| ≥ |a - b| must hold for all real numbers x. Let's analyze this inequality.\n\nFirst, note that |a - x b| is the distance between the point a and the point a - x b on the line through a and b. Similarly, |a - b| is the distance between a and b. The inequality |a - x b| ≥ |a - b| must hold for all x. Let's consider the case when x = 0. Then, the inequality becomes |a| ≥ |a - b|. Similarly, when x = 1, the inequality becomes |a - b| ≥ |a - b|, which is always true. When x = -1, the inequality becomes |a + b| ≥ |a - b|. When x = 0.5, the inequality becomes |a - 0.5 b| ≥ |a - b|. However, the most critical case is when x = 0, which gives |a| ≥ |a - b|. Let's see if this is always true.\n\nSuppose a and b are non-collinear. Then, the vector a - b is not parallel to a. Therefore, the distance between a and b is |a - b|. The distance between a and a - b is |a - (a - b)| = |b|. Therefore, the inequality |a| ≥ |b| must hold. But since a and b are non-collinear, this is a necessary condition.

The product of the ratios along each side is 1. This suggests that the quadrilateral EFGH is a harmonic quadrilateral, where the product of the ratios of the segments along each side is equal to 1. In a harmonic quadrilateral, the ratios of the segments along each side are reciprocals of each other. Therefore, if the product of the ratios is 1, then each ratio must be 1.

As \\(x\\) approaches infinity, \\(\\ln x\\) grows without bound, but \\(x\\) grows even faster. Therefore, the integrand \\(\\left(\\frac{\\ln x}{x}\\right)^{2011}\\) approaches 0 as \\(x\\) approaches infinity. This suggests that the integral converges.\n\nTo confirm this, we can use the comparison test. Let's compare the integrand to a simpler function. For large \\(x\\), \\(\\ln x\\) is approximately \\(\\ln x \\approx x - 1\\), so \\(\\frac{\\ln x}{x} \\approx \\frac{x - 1}{x} = 1 - \\frac{1}{x}\\). Therefore, \\(\\left(\\frac{\\ln x}{x}\\right)^{2011} \\approx \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{x}\\right)^{2011}\\).\n\nWe know that \\(\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{x}\\right)^{x}\\) approaches \\(e^{-1}\\) as \\(x\\) approaches infinity. Therefore, \\(\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{x}\\right)^{2011}\\) approaches \\(e^{-1}\\) as \\(x\\) approaches infinity. Since \\(e^{-1}\\) is a finite number, the integrand \\(\\left(\\frac{\\ln x}{x}\\right)^{2011}\\) is bounded above by a function that approaches 0 as \\(x\\) approaches infinity. Therefore, by the comparison test, the integral converges.\n\nHowever, to find the exact value of the integral, we need to use a more advanced technique. Let's consider the substitution \\(u = \\ln x\\). Then \\(du = \\frac{1}{x} dx\\), and when \\(x = 1\\), \\(u = 0\\), and as \\(x \\to \\infty\\), \\(u \\to \\infty\\). The integral becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} u^{2011} du\n\\]\n\nThis is a standard integral. The antiderivative of \\(u^{2011}\\) is \\(\\frac{u^{2012}}{2012}\\).

As \\(x\\) approaches infinity, \\(\\ln x\\) grows without bound, but \\(x\\) grows even faster. Therefore, the integrand \\(\\left(\\frac{\\ln x}{x}\\right)^{2011}\\) approaches 0 as \\(x\\) approaches infinity. This suggests that the integral converges.\n\nTo confirm this, we can use the comparison test. Let's compare the integrand to a simpler function. For large \\(x\\), \\(\\ln x\\) is approximately \\(\\ln x \\approx x - 1\\), so \\(\\frac{\\ln x}{x} \\approx \\frac{x - 1}{x} = 1 - \\frac{1}{x}\\). Therefore, \\(\\left(\\frac{\\ln x}{x}\\right)^{2011} \\approx \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{x}\\right)^{2011}\\).\n\nWe know that \\(\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{x}\\right)^{x}\\) approaches \\(e^{-1}\\) as \\(x\\) approaches infinity. Therefore, \\(\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{x}\\right)^{2011}\\) approaches \\(e^{-1}\\) as \\(x\\) approaches infinity. Since \\(e^{-1}\\) is a finite number, the integrand \\(\\left(\\frac{\\ln x}{x}\\right)^{2011}\\) is bounded above by a function that approaches 0 as \\(x\\) approaches infinity. Therefore, by the comparison test, the integral converges.\n\nHowever, to find the exact value of the integral, we need to use a more advanced technique. Let's consider the substitution \\(u = \\ln x\\). Then \\(du = \\frac{1}{x} dx\\), and when \\(x = 1\\), \\(u = 0\\), and as \\(x \\to \\infty\\), \\(u \\to \\infty\\). The integral becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} u^{2011} du\n\\]\n\nThis is a standard integral. The antiderivative of \\(u^{2011}\\) is \\(\\frac{u^{2012}}{2012}\\).

Hmm, let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, since the image of f must take exactly k different values, that means that the function f must map the elements of A into a subset of A with exactly k elements. The number of such functions is the number of ways to choose k elements from A and then arrange them in non-decreasing order. Wait, but the problem says \"the image takes exactly k different values,\" so the image of f is a subset of A with k elements. So, the function f must map the elements of A into a subset of A with exactly k elements, and the order of the elements in the image is non-decreasing. So, the image of f is a non-decreasing sequence of k elements from A.\n\nBut the problem also says that f(1) ≤ f(2) ≤ ... ≤ f(n). So, the function f is non-decreasing. Therefore, the image of f must be a non-decreasing sequence of k elements from A. So, the image of f is a non-decreasing sequence of k elements, and the function f maps the elements of A into this sequence.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of non-decreasing sequences of length k from the set A = {1, 2, ..., n} with the first element being 1. Because f(1) must be 1, and the rest of the sequence can be any elements from 1 to n, but the sequence must be non-decreasing.\n\nSo, the problem is equivalent to counting the number of non-decreasing sequences of length k from the set {1, 2, ..., n} with the first element being 1. This is a classic combinatorial problem. The number of such sequences is given by the binomial coefficient C(n-1, k-1). Let me verify this.\n\nLet's think about the problem again. We need to choose k elements from the set {1, 2, ..., n} and arrange them in non-decreasing order. The first element is fixed as 1, so we are left with choosing k-1 elements from the remaining n-1 elements. The number of ways to do this is C(n-1, k-1). For example, if n=3 and k=2, the possible sequences are 1,2; 1,3; 2,3. So, the number of such sequences is C(2,1)=2. Similarly, if n=4 and k=3, the possible sequences are 1,2,3; 1,2,4; 1,3,4; 2,3,4.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the product of all numbers in any row must be positive. Since each row has 6 cells, and each cell can be either +1 or -1, the product of all numbers in a row is positive if there are an even number of -1s in that row. Because multiplying an even number of negatives gives a positive result. So, each row must have an even number of -1s. Similarly, each column must also have an even number of -1s. So, the entire grid must be such that every row and every column has an even number of -1s.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the product of all numbers in any row and any column is positive\". So, not just each row, but every single row and every single column. So, the entire grid must have an even number of -1s in each row and each column. Therefore, the total number of -1s in the entire grid must be even. Because if each row has an even number of -1s, then the total number of -1s in the grid is the sum of the number of -1s in each row, which is even. Similarly, if each column has an even number of -1s, then the total number of -1s is the sum of the number of -1s in each column, which is also even. Therefore, the total number of -1s must be even.\n\nSo, the total number of -1s in the grid must be even. Let me denote the total number of -1s as E. Then E must be even. So, the problem reduces to finding the number of ways to place +1s and -1s in a 6x6 grid such that the total number of -1s is even.\n\nBut how do I approach this? Let me think. Each cell can be either +1 or -1. So, the total number of cells is 36. The number of ways to place +1s and -1s is 2^36. But not all of these are valid because we need the product of each row and each column to be positive. So, we need to subtract the invalid configurations where at least one row or one column has an odd number of -1s.\n\nBut how do I count the number of invalid configurations? Let me think. For a row or a column to have an odd number of -1s, we need to choose an odd number of -1s from the 6 cells. The number of ways to choose an odd number of -1s from 6 is the sum of the binomial coefficients for odd k: C(6,1) + C(6,3) + C(6,5). Let me compute that.\n\nC(6,1) = 6\n\nC(6,3) = 20\n\nC(6,5) = 6\n\nSo, total number of invalid rows or columns is 6 + 20 + 6 = 32.

Let's break down the process step by step.\n\nFirst, the cup is initially filled with a 15% saltwater solution. The volume ratios of the small, medium, and large balls are 10:5:3. Let's denote the volumes of the small, medium, and large balls as 10x, 5x, and 3x respectively, where x is a common multiplier.\n\nWhen the small ball is submerged in the saltwater, it displaces a volume equal to its own volume. Since the small ball is submerged, the volume of the saltwater displaced is equal to the volume of the small ball, which is 10x. The volume of the saltwater before the small ball was submerged is 15% of the total volume. Let's denote the total volume of the cup as V. Therefore, the volume of the saltwater before the small ball was submerged is 0.15V. After the small ball is submerged, the volume of the saltwater becomes 0.15V - 10x. The amount of salt in the cup is 15% of the initial volume, which is 0.15V * 0.15 = 0.0225V. The amount of salt displaced by the small ball is equal to the volume of the small ball, which is 10x. Therefore, the concentration of salt in the displaced water is (10x / (0.15V - 10x)).\n\nAfter the small ball is removed, the volume of the saltwater is 0.15V - 10x. The amount of salt remains the same, which is 0.0225V. The concentration of salt in the cup after the small ball is removed is (0.0225V / (0.15V - 10x)).\n\nNext, the medium ball is submerged. The medium ball has a volume of 5x. The volume of the saltwater displaced by the medium ball is equal to the volume of the medium ball, which is 5x. The concentration of salt in the displaced water is (5x / (0.15V - 10x)).\n\nAfter the medium ball is removed, the volume of the saltwater is (0.15V - 10x) - 5x = 0.15V - 15x. The amount of salt remains the same, which is 0.0225V. The concentration of salt in the cup after the medium ball is removed is (0.0225V / (0.15V - 15x)).\n\nFinally, the large ball is submerged. The large ball has a volume of 3x. The volume of the saltwater displaced by the large ball is equal to the volume of the large ball, which is 3x. The concentration of salt in the displaced water is (3x / (0.15V - 10x)).\n\nAfter the large ball is removed, the volume of the saltwater is (0.15V - 10x) - 3x = 0.15V - 13x.

The large ball has a volume of 3x. The volume of the saltwater displaced by the large ball is equal to the volume of the large ball, which is 3x. The concentration of salt in the displaced water is (3x / (0.15V - 10x)).\n\nAfter the large ball is removed, the volume of the saltwater is (0.15V - 10x) - 3x = 0.15V - 13x. The amount of salt remains the same, which is 0.0225V. The concentration of salt in the cup after the large ball is removed is (0.0225V / (0.15V - 13x)).\n\n<answer>\nThe concentration of saltwater in the cup after all the steps is (0.0225V / (0.15V - 13x)).\n</answer>\nThe concentration of saltwater in the cup after all the steps is (0.0225V / (0.15V - 13x)). To find the exact concentration, we need to know the total volume V of the cup. However, since the problem does not specify the total volume, we can express the concentration in terms of V. Let me note that the concentration is a function of V, so the answer is (0.0225V / (0.15V - 13x)) where x is the common multiplier for the volumes of the balls. If we had the total volume V, we could compute the numerical value. But since the problem does not provide V, the answer is given in terms of V. The concentration is 0.0225V divided by (0.15V - 13x). If we had the total volume, we could compute the numerical value. But as it stands, the answer is expressed in terms of V. The concentration is", "e71c071_correct": false}

The options are given from A to E, so I need to compute these probabilities and see which one matches.\n\nFirst, let's recall that the total number of ways to draw four slips from forty is the combination of 40 taken 4 at a time, which is 40C4. That's 40! divided by (40-4)! * 4! = 40*39*38*37 / 4*3*2*1 = 91,390. So, the total number of possible outcomes is 91,390.\n\nNow, let's tackle p first. The probability that all four slips bear the same number. Since there are four slips for each number, the number of ways to choose four slips all bearing the same number is 10 (one for each number from 1 to 10). So, p = 10 / 91,390.\n\nNext, let's compute q. The probability that two of the slips bear a number a and the other two bear a different number b. To find this, I need to calculate the number of favorable outcomes and divide by the total number of outcomes.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many ways we can choose two different numbers a and b. There are 10 numbers, so the number of ways to choose two different numbers is C(10,2) = 45. For each pair of numbers a and b, the number of ways to choose two slips from the four slips bearing a and two slips from the four slips bearing b is C(4,2) * C(4,2). Let me compute that.\n\nC(4,2) is 6, and C(4,2) is also 6. So, the number of ways for each pair (a, b) is 6 * 6 = 36. Therefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is 45 * 36.\n\nBut wait, this is the number of ways to choose two numbers a and b, and then choose two slips from each. However, we need to consider that the order in which we choose the two numbers a and b doesn't matter. For example, choosing slips with numbers 1 and 2 is the same as choosing slips with numbers 2 and 1. So, we need to divide by 2 to account for this overcounting.\n\nTherefore, the number of favorable outcomes is (45 * 36) / 2 = 45 * 18 = 810.\n\nSo, q = 810 / 91,390.\n\nNow, we need to compute q/p.

Therefore, the fraction cannot be simplified further. However, 810 and 91,390 are both divisible by 10, so dividing both by 10 gives 81/9,139. Since 81 is 9 squared, and 9,139 is 9139, which is 9139 divided by 9, which is 1015, and 1015 divided by 9 is 112.666..., which is not an integer.

The problem mentions that P is the midpoint of edge AB and Q is the midpoint of edge CD. Hmm, let me visualize this. A tetrahedron has four triangular faces, and all edges are equal. So, each edge is 1 unit long. The points P and Q are midpoints of two different edges. So, PQ connects the midpoints of AB and CD. To find the length of PQ, I need to consider the coordinates of these points and then compute the distance between them.\n\nLet me assign coordinates to the tetrahedron. Since all edges are 1 unit long, maybe using a coordinate system where each edge is 1 unit. Let me place point A at the origin (0,0,0). Then, since AB is 1 unit, point B would be at (1,0,0). Similarly, point C would be at (0,1,0) because CD is 1 unit, and point D would be at (0,0,1). Wait, but in a tetrahedron, the edges are between the vertices. So, AB is from A(0,0,0) to B(1,0,0), CD is from C(0,1,0) to D(0,0,1). So, the coordinates are:\n\nA: (0,0,0)\n\nB: (1,0,0)\n\nC: (0,1,0)\n\nD: (0,0,1)\n\nNow, P is the midpoint of AB. The midpoint formula for two points (x1, y1, z1) and (x2, y2, z2) is ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2, (z1 + z2)/2). So, P is the midpoint of AB, which is from A(0,0,0) to B(1,0,0). Therefore, P is at ((0 + 1)/2, (0 + 0)/2, (0 + 0)/2) = (0.5, 0, 0).\n\nSimilarly, Q is the midpoint of CD. CD is from C(0,1,0) to D(0,0,1). So, Q is at ((0 + 0)/2, (1 + 0)/2, (0 + 1)/2) = (0, 0.5, 0.5).\n\nNow, to find the distance between P(0.5, 0, 0) and Q(0, 0.5, 0.5). The distance formula between two points (x1, y1, z1) and (x2, y2, z2) is sqrt[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 + (z2 - z1)^2].

The midpoint formula for two points (x1, y1, z1) and (x2, y2, z2) is ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2, (z1 + z2)/2). So, P is the midpoint of AB, which is from A(0,0,0) to B(1,0,0). Therefore, P is at ((0 + 1)/2, (0 + 0)/2, (0 + 0)/2) = (0.5, 0, 0).\n\nSimilarly, Q is the midpoint of CD. CD is from C(0,1,0) to D(0,0,1). So, Q is at ((0 + 0)/2, (1 + 0)/2, (0 + 1)/2) = (0, 0.5, 0.5).\n\nNow, to find the distance between P(0.5, 0, 0) and Q(0, 0.5, 0.5). The distance formula between two points (x1, y1, z1) and (x2, y2, z2) is sqrt[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 + (z2 - z1)^2]. Plugging in the coordinates:\n\nDistance PQ = sqrt[(0 - 0.5)^2 + (0.5 - 0)^2 + (0.5 - 0)^2]\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n(0 - 0.5)^2 = 0.25\n\n(0.5 - 0)^2 = 0.25\n\n(0.5 - 0)^2 = 0.25\n\nAdding them up: 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25\n\n<answer>\nsqrt(0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25) = sqrt(0.75) = sqrt(3/4) = (sqrt(3)/2)\n</answer>\n<think>\nYes, that seems right. sqrt(0.75) is sqrt(3/4), which is sqrt(3)/2. So the length of PQ is sqrt(3)/2. Looking at the options, that's option B. So the answer should be B. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, assigning coordinates to the tetrahedron with all edges 1 unit. That seems correct. Then finding the midpoints P and Q. Midpoint of AB is (0.5, 0, 0), and midpoint of CD is (0, 0.5, 0.5). Then using the distance formula to compute PQ. Calculating each term correctly, adding them up, and taking the square root. The result is sqrt(3)/2, which is option B. So the answer is B.\n\nWait, let me verify again. If I have a tetrahedron with all edges 1", "e71c071_correct": true}

But is that always the case? Let me check with an example.\n\nConsider a permutation that swaps two elements and leaves the rest fixed. Let's denote this permutation as (a b)(c d)(e f)(g h)(i j)(k l)(m n)(o p)(q r)(s t). The order of this permutation is 11, because applying it 11 times will bring all elements back to", "e71c071_correct": false}

Rohan wants to cut the string into nine equal pieces, and Jai wants to cut it into eight equal pieces. Then, Yuvraj cuts the string at all the cutting points made by both Rohan and Jai. The question is asking how many pieces Yuvraj ends up with. The options are from 15 to 19. Hmm, let's think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider Rohan's cutting. He wants to cut the string into nine equal pieces. To do this, he needs to make eight cuts. Each cut creates a new segment, so eight cuts would result in nine segments. So, Rohan's cuts divide the string into nine equal parts. That makes sense.\n\nNow, Jai wants to cut the string into eight equal pieces. Similarly, he needs seven cuts. So, Jai's cuts would divide the string into eight equal parts. So, Jai's cuts would result in eight segments.\n\nNow, the tricky part is that Yuvraj is cutting the string at all the cutting points made by both Rohan and Jai. So, we need to find the total number of cutting points made by both Rohan and Jai, and then add one more cut to get the total number of pieces.\n\nLet's think about how many cutting points each person makes. Rohan makes eight cuts, so he creates eight cutting points. Jai makes seven cuts, so he creates seven cutting points. So, the total number of cutting points is 8 + 7 = 15. But wait, hold on. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nEach cut by Rohan creates one new segment, so Rohan's eight cuts create eight new segments. Similarly, Jai's seven cuts create seven new segments. So, the total number of segments created by both Rohan and Jai is 8 + 7 = 15. But the question is asking how many pieces Yuvraj obtains. So, the number of pieces is equal to the number of segments plus one. Because when you make a cut, you create one new segment. So, if there are 15 segments, then Yuvraj would have 15 + 1 = 16 pieces. But wait, the answer choices are from 15 to 19. So, 16 is one of the options. So, that seems right.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made a mistake. Let me think again. If Rohan makes eight cuts, each creating one new segment, so he creates eight segments. Similarly, Jai makes seven cuts, creating seven segments. So, total segments are 8 + 7 = 15. Then, when Yuvraj cuts the string at all these points, he would create 15 + 1 = 16 pieces. But the answer choices are 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. So, 16 is one of the options. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of the number of segments. If Rohan makes eight cuts, he creates eight segments. Similarly, Jai makes seven cuts, creating seven segments. So, total segments are 8 + 7 = 15. Then, when Yuvraj cuts the string at all these points, he would create 15 + 1 = 16 pieces.

S is the set of all permutations of (1, 2, ..., n) where exactly one element is greater than all its predecessors. The question is asking for the average of these first elements a₁ across all such permutations.\n\nTo find the mean, we need to compute the sum of a₁ over all permutations in S and then divide by the number of permutations in S. Since there are n! permutations in total, the mean is (sum of a₁ over all S) / n!.\n\nNow, let's consider how to approach this. For each permutation in S, the first element a₁ is the first element that is greater than all its predecessors. So, for each permutation, we need to count how many times a₁ is the first element that is greater than all its predecessors.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of this problem in terms of the number of inversions in the permutation. An inversion is a pair (i, j) such that i < j and a_i > a_j. The number of inversions in a permutation is equal to the number of elements that are greater than all their predecessors. Therefore, the number of permutations in S is equal to the number of permutations with exactly one inversion.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the number of permutations with exactly one inversion and then dividing by n! to get the mean.\n\nLet's denote the number of permutations with exactly one inversion as C(n, 1).

Therefore, the number of such permutations is equal to the number of ways to choose one element to be the first element that is greater than all its predecessors, which is C(n, 1) = n.\n\nTherefore, the mean is C(n, 1) / n! = n / n! = 1 / (n - 1)!.\n\nWait, but let me verify this reasoning. Let's consider small values of n to see if this formula holds.\n\nFor n = 1: There is only one permutation, which is (1). The first element is 1, which is greater than all predecessors. So, the mean is 1. The formula gives 1 / (1 - 1)! = 1 / 0! = 1. Correct.\n\nFor n = 2: There are two permutations: (1, 2) and (2, 1). In the first permutation, the first element is 1, which is greater than all predecessors. In the second permutation, the first element is 2, which is greater than all predecessors.

The grid is a 2012 x 2012 grid, and the fly can move to adjacent intersections or stay in place. Each spider can also move to adjacent intersections or stay in place. The goal is to find the smallest number of spiders (k) such that the spiders can always catch the fly in a finite number of operations, regardless of the fly's initial position.\n\nFirst, let's consider the 2D grid. The problem is similar to the classic \"n-puzzle\" or \"8-puzzle\" problem, where the goal is to move the fly to a specific position. The key here is that the spiders can move to adjacent intersections or stay in place, which allows them to potentially block the fly's path. The question is whether there exists a strategy where the spiders can always catch the fly, regardless of the fly's starting position.\n\nTo approach this, we need to consider the concept of \"capture\" in the grid.

If the fly is in one of the four corners, the spiders can block the fly's path by occupying adjacent intersections.

Hmm, let's start by understanding what this problem is asking. We need to find all primes p where there's some n where the expression p^n + 3^n divides p^{n+1} + 3^{n+1}. That means that when we divide p^{n+1} + 3^{n+1} by p^n + 3^n, the remainder is zero. So, in other words, p^{n+1} + 3^{n+1} is a multiple of p^n + 3^n. Therefore, p^{n+1} + 3^{n+1} ≡ 0 mod (p^n + 3^n). Let me write that as p^{n+1} ≡ -3^{n+1} mod (p^n + 3^n). So, the remainder when p^{n+1} is divided by p^n + 3^n is -3^{n+1}. That seems a bit unusual because usually, when you divide by a polynomial, the remainder is a polynomial of degree less than the divisor. But here, the remainder is a constant, which is -3^{n+1}. That suggests that p^{n+1} is congruent to -3^{n+1} modulo p^n + 3^n. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, maybe I can use the division algorithm here. Since p^n + 3^n divides p^{n+1} + 3^{n+1}, then p^{n+1} + 3^{n+1} = (p^n + 3^n) * q + r, where q is the quotient and r is the remainder. Since the remainder must be less than the divisor, r < p^n + 3^n. But here, the remainder is -3^{n+1}, which is less than p^n + 3^n. So, r = -3^{n+1}. Therefore, p^{n+1} + 3^{n+1} = (p^n + 3^n) * q - 3^{n+1}. Let me rearrange this equation:\n\np^{n+1} + 3^{n+1} = (p^n + 3^n) * q - 3^{n+1}\n\nAdding 3^{n+1} to both sides:\n\np^{n+1} + 3^{n+1} + 3^{n+1} = (p^n + 3^n) * q\n\nSimplify:\n\np^{n+1} + 2 * 3^{n+1} = (p^n + 3^n) * q\n\nSo, p^{n+1} + 2 * 3^{n+1} = (p^n + 3^n) * q\n\nTherefore, q = [p^{n+1} + 2 * 3^{n+1}] / (p^n + 3^n). Since q must be an integer, the numerator must be divisible by the denominator. So, p^{n+1} + 2 * 3^{n+1} must be divisible by p^n + 3^n. Let me denote this as:\n\np^{n+1} + 2 * 3^{n+1} ≡ 0 mod (\n\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant that provides well‑reasoned but short responses.\nYou first briefly think about the reasoning process as an internal monologue and then provide the user with the answer.\nRespond in the following format:\n\nProblem: Problem 4.

That seems a bit unusual because usually, when you divide by a polynomial, the remainder is a polynomial of degree less than the divisor. But here, the remainder is a constant, which is -3^{n+1}. That suggests that p^{n+1} is congruent to -3^{n+1} modulo p^n + 3^n. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, maybe I can use the division algorithm here. Since p^n + 3^n divides p^{n+1} + 3^{n+1}, then p^{n+1} + 3^{n+1} = (p^n + 3^n) * q + r, where q is the quotient and r is the remainder. Since the remainder must be less than the divisor, r < p^n + 3^n. But here, the remainder is -3^{n+1}, which is less than p^n + 3^n. So, r = -3^{n+1}. Therefore, p^{n+1} + 3^{n+1} = (p^n + 3^n) * q - 3^{n+1}. Let me rearrange this equation:\n\np^{n+1} + 3^{n+1} = (p^n + 3^n) * q - 3^{n+1}\n\nAdding 3^{n+1} to both sides:\n\np^{n+1} + 3^{n+1} + 3^{n+1} = (p^n + 3^n) * q\n\nSimplify:\n\np^{n+1} + 2 * 3^{n+1} = (p^n + 3^n) * q\n\nSo, p^{n+1} + 2 * 3^{n+1} = (p^n + 3^n) * q\n\nTherefore, q = [p^{n+1} + 2 * 3^{n+1}] / (p^n + 3^n). Since q must be an integer, the numerator must be divisible by the denominator. So, p^{n+1} + 2 * 3^{n+1} must be divisible by p^n + 3^n. Let me denote this as:\n\np^{n+1} + 2 * 3^{n+1} ≡ 0 mod (\n\n<answer>\nTherefore, p^{n+1} ≡ -2 * 3^{n+1} mod (p^n + 3^n). Let's denote this as:\n\np^{n+1} ≡ -2 * 3^{n+1} mod (p^n + 3^n)\n\nSo, we need to find all primes p such that there exists some n in the natural numbers (positive integers) satisfying this congruence. Let's analyze this congruence.\n\nFirst, note that p and 3 are coprime, so we can consider the congruence modulo p and modulo 3 separately.\n\n1. Modulo p: p^{n+1} ≡ -2 * 3^{n+1} mod p\n\nSince p is prime, Fermat's Little Theorem tells us that p divides 3^{p-1} - 1. Therefore, 3^{p-1} ≡ 1 mod p. Let's denote 3^{p-1} ≡ 1 mod p. Then, 3^{n+1} ≡ 3 * 3^{n} ≡ 3 * 3^{n} mod p. Similarly,", "e71c071_correct": false}

The problem states that there are four spheres placed inside the cone, each touching each other externally and the lateral surface of the cone. Three of these spheres have a radius of 3, and they also touch the base of the cone. The angle between the slant height and the base of the cone is π/3. Hmm, let me visualize this cone first.\n\nFirst, the angle between the slant height and the base is π/3. That means the slant height forms a 30-degree angle with the base. So, if I imagine the cone, the slant height is the hypotenuse of a right triangle where the base angle is 30 degrees. The radius of the base would then be the adjacent side, which is 3. So, the radius of the base is 3 * tan(30°). Let me calculate that. tan(30°) is √3/3, so 3 * √3/3 = √3. So, the radius of the base is √3. Therefore, the height of the cone would be the opposite side, which is 3 * tan(30°) = 3√3. So, the height of the cone is 3√3.\n\nNow, the three spheres with radius 3 are touching each other externally and the lateral surface of the cone. The fourth sphere is touching all three of these spheres externally and the base of the cone. The angle between the slant height and the base is π/3, so the slant height is 3√3. The angle between the slant height and the base is 30 degrees, so the slant height is 3 times the radius of the base. So, the slant height is 3√3, which is 3 times the radius of the base. Therefore, the radius of the base is √3, which is 3 times the radius of the fourth sphere. So, if the radius of the fourth sphere is r, then 3r = √3. Therefore, r = √3 / 3. But wait, that seems too simple. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the three spheres have radius 3, and they touch each other externally and the lateral surface of the cone.

Then he arrived at his destination between 2 and 3 in the afternoon, when the hands were pointing in exactly opposite directions. We need to figure out how long his walk lasted. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall how the clock hands move. The hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours, so each hour it moves 30 degrees. The minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes, so each minute it moves 6 degrees. The hour hand also moves as the minutes pass, so the minute hand gains on the hour hand by 0.5 degrees per minute (since 30 degrees per hour divided by 60 minutes is 0.5 degrees per minute). So, the relative speed between the hour and minute hands is 0.5 degrees per minute.\n\nWhen the hands are aligned, they are at the same position. Let's find out how long it takes for the hands to align. The hands align every 12 hours, but since Henry's walk started at 8:00 AM and ended at 2:00 PM, which is 16 hours later, we need to find the time between 8:00 AM and 2:00 PM when the hands are aligned.\n\nLet's denote the time as 8:00 AM + t minutes. At 8:00 AM, the hour hand is at 8*30 = 240 degrees, and the minute hand is at 0 degrees. The minute hand moves 6 degrees per minute, so after t minutes, it's at 6t degrees. The hour hand moves 0.5 degrees per minute, so after t minutes, it's at 240 + 0.5t degrees. For the hands to be aligned, these two positions must be equal:\n\n240 + 0.5t = 6t\n\nLet's solve for t:\n\n240 = 6t - 0.5t\n240 = 5.5t\nt = 240 / 5.5\nt = 43.636... minutes\n\nSo, the hands align at approximately 8:43.64 minutes AM. That's a bit before 9:00 AM. So Henry started his walk at 8:43.64 AM and ended at 2:00 PM. Let's convert 2:00 PM to minutes after 8:43.64 AM. From 8:43.64 AM to 9:00 AM is 16 minutes.

Let me start by understanding the given information.\n\nFirst, the parabola C has focus F and vertex at the origin O. Since it's a parabola with vertex at the origin, its equation can be written as y² = 4ax, where a is the distance from the vertex to the focus. But the problem mentions that F is a moving point on the positive x-axis. So, if F is on the positive x-axis, then the focus F is at (a, 0), where a is the distance from the vertex to the focus. Therefore, the equation of the parabola is y² = 4ax, where a is the distance from the vertex to the focus.\n\nNow, point P is a point on the parabola in the first quadrant. Since it's on the parabola, its coordinates can be written as (x, y) where x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0. The coordinates of P satisfy the equation y² = 4ax.\n\nPoint Q is on the negative half-axis of the x-axis, so its coordinates are (-b, 0) where b is a positive number.

We need to find the coordinates of F such that the sum of the areas of circles C1 and C2 is minimized.\n\nCircles C1 and C2 both touch the line OP at point P, and are tangent to the x-axis. Let me recall that a circle that is tangent to the x-axis has its center on the y-axis at some point (0, h), and its radius is h. So, the equation of such a circle is x² + (y - h)² = h². Since it's tangent to the x-axis, the distance from the center to the x-axis is equal to the radius, so h = h. Therefore, the equation simplifies to x² + y² = h². But since the circle is tangent to the x-axis, the center is at (0, h), and the radius is h. So, the equation of the circle is x² + (y - h)² = h².\n\nNow, the circles C1 and C2 both touch the line OP at point P. Let me note that OP is the line connecting the origin O (0,0) to point P (x, y). The equation of OP can be written as y = (y/x)x. So, the line OP has a slope of y/x. The distance from the center of the circle (0, h) to the line OP is equal to the radius h. The formula for the distance from a point (x0, y0) to a line Ax + By + C = 0 is |Ax0 + By0 + C| / sqrt(A² + B²). In this case, the line OP is y = (y/x)x, which can be written as y - (y/x)x = 0.

The face $SBC$ is perpendicular to the base and $SB=SC$. Calculate the radius of the sphere inscribed in the pyramid if the height of the pyramid is 1.4 cm.\n\n<think>\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\nAlright, so I need to find the radius of the sphere inscribed in the pyramid SABC. The base is a triangle ABC with AB and AC both 10 cm, BC 12 cm. The face SBC is perpendicular to the base, and SB and SC are equal. The height of the pyramid is 1.4 cm. Hmm, let me visualize this. The pyramid has a triangular base ABC, and the face SBC is perpendicular to the base. That means the plane containing SBC is perpendicular to the plane of ABC. Also, SB and SC are equal, so triangle SBC is isosceles with SB = SC. The height of the pyramid is 1.4 cm, so the distance from the apex S to the base ABC is 1.4 cm. The sphere is inscribed in the pyramid, meaning it touches all the faces. To find the radius, I need to calculate the area of the base, the area of the faces, and then use the formula for the radius of the inscribed sphere.\n\nFirst, let's find the area of the base triangle ABC. Since AB = AC = 10 cm, triangle ABC is isosceles with AB = AC. Let me find the length of BC, which is given as 12 cm. To find the area, I can use Heron's formula. First, calculate the semi-perimeter s:\n\ns = (AB + AC + BC)/2 = (10 + 10 + 12)/2 = 32/2 = 16 cm.\n\nThen, the area A is sqrt(s(s - AB)(s - AC)(s - BC)):\n\nA = sqrt(16*(16 - 10)*(16 - 10)*(16 - 12)) = sqrt(16*6*6*4) = sqrt(16*144) = sqrt(2304) = 48 cm².\n\nSo the area of the base is 48 cm².\n\nNow, the face SBC is perpendicular to the base ABC. Since the pyramid is SABC, the base is ABC, and the apex is S. The face SBC is perpendicular to the base, so the plane SBC is perpendicular to the plane ABC. Therefore, the height of the pyramid is the distance from S to the base ABC, which is 1.4 cm. The height of the pyramid is also the distance from S to the base, which is the same as the height of the pyramid. So the height of the pyramid is 1.4 cm.\n\nNext, I need to find the area of the face SBC. Since the face SBC is perpendicular to the base ABC, the base of the face SBC is the triangle ABC, and the height of the face SBC is the height of the pyramid, which is 1.4 cm. The area of triangle SBC can be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle: (base * height)/2. The base of triangle SBC is BC, which is 12 cm, and the height is the height of the pyramid, which is 1.4 cm. So the area of triangle SBC is (12 * 1.4)/2 = 16.8 cm².\n\nNow, the total surface area of the pyramid is the sum of the areas of the base and the three triangular faces.

The face $SBC$ is perpendicular to the base and $SB=SC$. Calculate the radius of the sphere inscribed in the pyramid if the height of the pyramid is 1.4 cm.\n\n<think>\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\nAlright, so I need to find the radius of the sphere inscribed in the pyramid SABC. The base is a triangle ABC with AB and AC both 10 cm, BC 12 cm. The face SBC is perpendicular to the base, and SB and SC are equal. The height of the pyramid is 1.4 cm. Hmm, let me visualize this. The pyramid has a triangular base ABC, and the face SBC is perpendicular to the base. That means the plane containing SBC is perpendicular to the plane of ABC. Also, SB and SC are equal, so triangle SBC is isosceles with SB = SC. The height of the pyramid is 1.4 cm, so the distance from the apex S to the base ABC is 1.4 cm. The sphere is inscribed in the pyramid, meaning it touches all the faces. To find the radius, I need to calculate the area of the base, the area of the faces, and then use the formula for the radius of the inscribed sphere.\n\nFirst, let's find the area of the base triangle ABC. Since AB = AC = 10 cm, triangle ABC is isosceles with AB = AC. Let me find the length of BC, which is given as 12 cm. To find the area, I can use Heron's formula. First, calculate the semi-perimeter s:\n\ns = (AB + AC + BC)/2 = (10 + 10 + 12)/2 = 32/2 = 16 cm.\n\nThen, the area A is sqrt(s(s - AB)(s - AC)(s - BC)):\n\nA = sqrt(16*(16 - 10)*(16 - 10)*(16 - 12)) = sqrt(16*6*6*4) = sqrt(16*144) = sqrt(2304) = 48 cm².\n\nSo the area of the base is 48 cm².\n\nNow, the face SBC is perpendicular to the base ABC. Since the pyramid is SABC, the base is ABC, and the apex is S. The face SBC is perpendicular to the base, so the plane SBC is perpendicular to the plane ABC. Therefore, the height of the pyramid is the distance from S to the base ABC, which is 1.4 cm. The height of the pyramid is also the distance from S to the base, which is the same as the height of the pyramid. So the height of the pyramid is 1.4 cm.\n\nNext, I need to find the area of the face SBC. Since the face SBC is perpendicular to the base ABC, the base of the face SBC is the triangle ABC, and the height of the face SBC is the height of the pyramid, which is 1.4 cm. The area of triangle SBC can be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle: (base * height)/2. The base of triangle SBC is BC, which is 12 cm, and the height is the height of the pyramid, which is 1.4 cm. So the area of triangle SBC is (12 * 1.4)/2 = 16.8 cm².\n\nNow, the total surface area of the pyramid is the sum of the areas of the base and the three triangular faces. The base is a triangle with area 48 cm², and the three triangular faces are SBC, SAC, and SAB. The area of triangle SAC is the same as\n\n<answer>\n48 cm² + 16.8 cm² + (12 cm * 1.4 cm)/2 = 48 + 16.8 + 8.4 = 73.2 cm².\n\nThe total surface area is 73.2 cm². The volume of the pyramid can be calculated using the formula (1/3) * base area * height. The base area is 48 cm², and the height is 1.4 cm, so the volume is (1/3)*48*1.4 = 67.2/3 = 22.4 cm³.\n\nThe volume of the pyramid is also equal to the sum of the areas of the three triangular faces. Let's check that. The area of triangle SBC is 16.8 cm², and the areas of triangles SAC and SAB can be found using the formula (1/2)*base*height. For triangle SAC, the base is AB = 10 cm, and the height is the height of the pyramid, which is 1.4 cm. So the area of SAC is (1/2)*10*1.4 =", "e71c071_correct": false}

The time it took him to do that is 26 minutes. Now, the question is asking how long it would take him to trace all the lines on a 5 by 5 checkered square. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to recall that a checkered rectangle is a grid with alternating black and white squares. The number of lines in such a grid can be calculated by considering the number of rows and columns. For a rectangle of size m by n, the total number of lines is 2m + 2n - 4. That's because each row has m lines, each column has n lines, but the corners are counted twice, so we subtract 4. Let me verify that. For example, a 2x2 grid has 4 lines: 2 horizontal and 2 vertical. Correct. So, for a 3x7 grid, the total number of lines would be 2*3 + 2*7 - 4 = 6 + 14 - 4 = 16 lines. Wait, that's 16 lines. So, the robot took 26 minutes to trace 16 lines. Therefore, the time per line is 26 minutes divided by 16 lines, which is 1.625 minutes per line. So, each line takes 1.625 minutes.\n\nNow, the question is about a 5x5 grid. Let's calculate the total number of lines. Using the formula: 2*5 + 2*5 - 4 = 10 + 10 - 4 = 16 lines. So, the total number of lines is 16. Since each line takes 1.625 minutes, the total time would be 16 lines multiplied by 1.625 minutes per line. Let me compute that. 16*1.625. Let me break it down. 16*1.6 is 25.6, and 25.6*0.625 is 16*0.625 = 10, and 25.6*0.125 = 3.2. So, 10 + 3.2 = 13.2 minutes. Therefore, the answer should be 13.2 minutes. Let me check if that makes sense. If each line takes 1.625 minutes, then 16 lines would indeed take 13.25 minutes, which is 13 minutes and 15 seconds. That seems reasonable. So, the answer is 13.2 minutes.\n\nFinal answer: 13.2 minutes. Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. 16*1.6 is 25.6, 25.6*0.625 is 16*0.625=10, 25.6*0.125=3.2. So, 10 + 3.2 = 13.2. That seems correct. So, the answer is 13.2 minutes. Let me confirm with another method to be sure. If each line takes 1.625 minutes, then 16 lines would be 16*1.6\n\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant that provides well‑reasoned but short responses.\nYou first briefly think about the reasoning process as an internal monologue and then provide the user with the answer.\nRespond in the following format:\n\nProblem: 7.2.

Also, all the roots of P(x) are real. Hmm, let me recall how to approach this.\n\nFirst, since all the roots are real, the polynomial must have real coefficients.

Angle AED is at point E, so the angle between AE and ED. Let me find the coordinates of points A, E, and D.\n\nPoint A is at (0,0), point E is at (c*t, 0), and point D is at (a,0). The vector AE is from A to E, which is (c*t, 0). The vector ED is from E to D, which is (a - c*t, 0). The angle between AE and ED is the angle between these two vectors. The angle between two vectors can be found using the dot product formula:\n\ncosθ = (AE · ED) / (|AE| |ED|)\n\nFirst, compute the dot product AE · ED:\n\nAE · ED = (c*t)(a - c*t) + (0)(0) = c*t*(a - c*t)\n\nThen, compute the magnitudes |AE| and |ED|:\n\n|AE| = sqrt[(c*t)^2 + 0^2] = c*t\n\n|ED| = sqrt[(a - c*t)^2 + 0^2] = |a - c*t|\n\nTherefore, cosθ = (c*t*(a - c*t)) / (c*t * |a - c*t|) = (a - c*t) / |a - c*t|\n\nBut angle AED is 90 degrees plus half of angle C. Let me denote angle C as θ_C. Then angle AED is 90\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\nThe answer is (B) A C. The problem involves a triangle ABC with D as the midpoint of AB. Point E is on AC such that angle AED is 90 degrees plus half of angle C. To find BC + 2AE, which is one of the options given. Let me try to visualize the triangle and set up equations based on the given conditions.\n\nFirst, let me assign coordinates to the triangle to make calculations easier. Let me place point A at the origin (0,0). Since D is the midpoint of AB, if I let AB have length 2a, then D would be at (a,0). Let me denote the coordinates of point C as (c,0) since AB is horizontal. Then point B would be at (2a,0) because D is the midpoint.\n\nNow, point E is on AC. Let me parameterize the coordinates of E. Since AC is from A(0,0) to C(c,0), the coordinates of E can be written as (t*c, 0) where 0 ≤ t ≤ 1. Wait, but E is on AC, so its x-coordinate is between 0 and c. However,", "e71c071_correct": false}

Hmm, let's see. I remember that trigonometric identities can sometimes help here. Maybe I can use some double-angle or triple-angle formulas, but I'm not sure.

So substituting back into the expression:\n\n1 - 4*(sin80° + sin60°)/2 = 1 - 2*(sin80° + sin60°). So now, the expression simplifies to 1 - 2*(sin80° + sin60°).

So, I need to solve the inequality:\n\nx² - 2x - 2.5 > 0\n\nLet me solve this quadratic inequality. To do that, I can find the roots of the equation x² - 2x - 2.5 = 0. Let me use the quadratic formula here. The quadratic formula is x = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a). Here, a = 1, b = -2, c = -2.5. Plugging in these values:\n\nx = [2 ± sqrt(4 + 10)] / 2\n\nSimplify inside the square root: 4 + 10 = 14. So, sqrt(14). Therefore, x = [2 ± sqrt(14)] / 2\n\nSo, the roots are x = (2 + sqrt(14))/2 and x = (2 - sqrt(14))/2. Since sqrt(14) is approximately 3.74, the roots are approximately x ≈ 2.82 and x ≈ -0.82. Therefore, the quadratic x² - 2x - 2.5 is positive outside these roots. So, the inequality x² - 2x - 2.5 > 0 is satisfied when x < -0.82 or x > 2.82.\n\nSo, the argument of the logarithm is positive when x is in (-∞, -0.82) ∪ (2.82, ∞). But wait, we also need to make sure that the argument of the logarithm is positive. So, the entire expression inside the logarithm is positive. Therefore, the entire expression is defined when x is in (-∞, -0.82) ∪ (2.82, ∞).\n\nBut wait, there's another condition. The original expression is log base 3 of (1 - log base 0.5 of (x² - 2x - 2.5)). For this logarithm to be defined, the argument must be positive. So, we need to ensure that 1 - log base 0.5 of (x² - 2x - 2.5) > 0. Let me write that as:\n\n1 - log base 0.5 of (x² - 2x - 2.5) > 0\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\nlog base 0.5 of (x² - 2x - 2.5) < 1\n\nSo, the argument of the logarithm here is x² - 2x\n\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant that provides well‑reasoned but short responses.\nYou first briefly think about the reasoning process as an internal monologue and then provide the user with the answer.\nRespond in the following format:\n\nProblem: 9.114.

We need to find the maximum number of regions formed inside the triangle, with the condition that every two regions are disjoint. The prime number p is at least 3. Hmm, let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall that when you divide a triangle into smaller regions by connecting the midpoints of its sides, you get 4 regions. That's a known result. But here, the sides are divided into p equal parts, so instead of midpoints, we have points that divide each side into p equal segments. So, each side is divided into p parts, and lines are drawn from each division point to the opposite vertex. So, for each side, there are p lines, and since there are three sides, that would be 3p lines. But wait, each line connects a division point to the opposite vertex. So, for each side, there are p lines, and since there are three sides, that's 3p lines. But each line is drawn from a division point to the opposite vertex. So, each line is a diagonal from a division point to the opposite vertex. So, the total number of lines is 3p. But each line is a diagonal, so each diagonal is a line connecting two division points on different sides. So, the total number of diagonals is 3p. But wait, each diagonal is counted twice in the total number of lines (once for each endpoint), so the actual number of diagonals is 3p/2. But since the number of diagonals must be an integer, 3p/2 must be an integer. But 3p is always odd (since p is prime and p ≥ 3), so 3p/2 is always an integer. So, the number of diagonals is 3p/2. But wait, 3p is odd, so 3p/2 is odd. But the number of regions formed by diagonals in a triangle is given by the formula R = 1 + (n(n + 1))/2, where n is the number of diagonals. So, substituting n = 3p/2, we get R = 1 + (3p/2)(3p/2 + 1)/2. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, compute (3p/2)(3p/2 + 1)/2. Let's simplify that step by step. Let's denote 3p/2 as k. Then, the expression becomes (k)(k + 1)/2. So, R = 1 + (k(k + 1))/2. Let's compute k(k + 1). That's k² + k. So, R = 1 + (k² + k)/2. Let's compute 1 + (k² + k)/2. That's 1 + k²/2 + k/2. So, R = (k²/2 + k/2 + 1). Let's compute k²/2 + k/2. That's (k² + k)/2. So, R = (k² + k)/2 + 1. But k is 3p/2. So, substitute k = 3p/2 into the expression. So, R = [(3p/2)² + (3p/2)]/2 + 1. Let's compute (3p/2)².

So, the base is a square with side length 1, and PD is 1 unit long. The pyramid has a vertex P, and the base is ABCD. The question is asking about the size relationship between d1 and d2.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the pyramid. The base is a square ABCD, so all sides are equal, and all angles are right angles. The vertex P is directly above the center of the square base. Since PD is perpendicular to the base, that means PD is a vertical line from P to the center of the square.

Find a formula for the $n$-th term of this progression.\n\n<think>\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the least possible order of this arithmetic progression. Let me start by understanding what each order means. An arithmetic progression of the first order is just an arithmetic progression, so that's straightforward. The second order would be the differences between terms forming another arithmetic progression. Then, for higher orders, the differences between terms form an arithmetic progression of one less order. So, for example, the third order would be the differences between terms forming an arithmetic progression of the second order, and so on.\n\nLet me first check if these numbers form an arithmetic progression. To do that, I need to check if the differences between consecutive terms are constant. Let's calculate the differences:\n\n6 - 4 = 2\n\n13 - 6 = 7\n\n27 - 13 = 14\n\n50 - 27 = 23\n\n84 - 50 = 34\n\nSo the differences are 2, 7, 14, 23, 34. Let me see if these differences form an arithmetic progression. The differences between them are:\n\n7 - 2 = 5\n\n14 - 7 = 7\n\n23 - 14 = 9\n\n34 - 23 = 11\n\nSo the differences between the differences are 5, 7, 9, 11. Let's check if these form an arithmetic progression. The differences between them are:\n\n7 - 5 = 2\n\n9 - 7 = 2\n\n11 - 9 = 2\n\nSo the differences between the differences are 2, 2, 2. That's an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 0. So the differences between the differences are constant, which means that the original sequence is an arithmetic progression of the first order. Therefore, the least possible order is 1.\n\nNow, the problem says that the numbers are the first six terms of this progression. So the first term is 4, and the sixth term is 84. Since it's an arithmetic progression of the first order, the common difference d is (84 - 4)/5 = 80/5 = 16. So the formula for the nth term would be 4 + (n - 1)*16.\n\nWait, but let me verify that. Let's check the first six terms:\n\n1st term: 4\n\n2nd term: 4 + 16 = 20\n\n3rd term: 20 + 16 = 36\n\n4th term: 36 + 16 = 52\n\n5th term: 52 + 16 = 68\n\n6th term: 68 + 16 = 84\n\nYes, that matches the given sequence. So the formula is correct. Therefore, the least possible order is 1, and the formula for the nth term is 4 + (n - 1)*16.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the order. The problem says \"the numbers are the first six terms of an arithmetic progression of some order. What is its least possible order? Find a formula for the n-th term of this progression.\" So the order is the order of the differences between terms, not the order of the terms themselves. So even though the original sequence is an arithmetic progression, the order is determined by the order of the differences. So the least possible order is 1, which is the first order.

What is its least possible order? Find a formula for the $n$-th term of this progression.\n\n<think>\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the least possible order of this arithmetic progression. Let me start by understanding what each order means. An arithmetic progression of the first order is just an arithmetic progression, so that's straightforward. The second order would be the differences between terms forming another arithmetic progression. Then, for higher orders, the differences between terms form an arithmetic progression of one less order. So, for example, the third order would be the differences between terms forming an arithmetic progression of the second order, and so on.\n\nLet me first check if these numbers form an arithmetic progression. To do that, I need to check if the differences between consecutive terms are constant. Let's calculate the differences:\n\n6 - 4 = 2\n\n13 - 6 = 7\n\n27 - 13 = 14\n\n50 - 27 = 23\n\n84 - 50 = 34\n\nSo the differences are 2, 7, 14, 23, 34. Let me see if these differences form an arithmetic progression. The differences between them are:\n\n7 - 2 = 5\n\n14 - 7 = 7\n\n23 - 14 = 9\n\n34 - 23 = 11\n\nSo the differences between the differences are 5, 7, 9, 11. Let's check if these form an arithmetic progression. The differences between them are:\n\n7 - 5 = 2\n\n9 - 7 = 2\n\n11 - 9 = 2\n\nSo the differences between the differences are 2, 2, 2. That's an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 0. So the differences between the differences are constant, which means that the original sequence is an arithmetic progression of the first order. Therefore, the least possible order is 1.\n\nNow, the problem says that the numbers are the first six terms of this progression. So the first term is 4, and the sixth term is 84. Since it's an arithmetic progression of the first order, the common difference d is (84 - 4)/5 = 80/5 = 16. So the formula for the nth term would be 4 + (n - 1)*16.\n\nWait, but let me verify that. Let's check the first six terms:\n\n1st term: 4\n\n2nd term: 4 + 16 = 20\n\n3rd term: 20 + 16 = 36\n\n4th term: 36 + 16 = 52\n\n5th term: 52 + 16 = 68\n\n6th term: 68 + 16 = 84\n\nYes, that matches the given sequence. So the formula is correct. Therefore, the least possible order is 1, and the formula for the nth term is 4 + (n - 1)*16.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the order. The problem says \"the numbers are the first six terms of an arithmetic progression of some order. What is its least possible order? Find a formula for the n-th term of this progression.\" So the order is the order of the differences between terms, not the order of the terms themselves. So even though the original sequence is an arithmetic progression, the order is determined by the order of the differences. So the least possible order is 1, which is the first order. The formula is 4 + (n\n\n<answer>\nThe least possible order of the arithmetic progression is 1, and the formula for the nth term is 4 + (n - 1)*16. Therefore, the answer is 1 and 4 + (n - 1)*16.\n</answer>You are a helpful AI assistant.

The problem states that the number a is 100 greater than the difference between the numbers 50700 and 30200. So, we need to find the value of a first.\n\nStarting with the difference between 50700 and 30200. Let's compute that:\n\n50700 - 30200 = 20500\n\nSo, the difference is 20500. Then, a is 100 greater than this difference. Therefore, a = 20500 + 100 = 20600.\n\nNext, the number b is the successor of seven times 583. Let's compute seven times 583 first.\n\n7 * 583 = 7 * (500 + 80 + 3) = 7 * 500 + 7 * 80 + 7 * 3\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n7 * 500 = 3500\n\n7 * 80 = 560\n\n7 * 3 = 21\n\nAdding them together: 3500 + 560 + 21 = 4081\n\nSo, seven times 583 is 4081. The successor of 4081 is 4081 + 1 = 4082. Therefore, b = 4082.\n\nNow, the number c is the third part of the predecessor of 2101. Let's find the predecessor of 2101 first.\n\nThe predecessor of a number is one less than that number. So, the predecessor of 2101 is 2101 - 1 = 2100.\n\nThen, c is the third part of 2100. To find a third part, we divide 2100 by 3.\n\n2100 ÷ 3 = 700\n\nTherefore, c = 700.\n\nNow, we have all three numbers: a = 20600, b = 4082, c = 700.\n\nTo find their sum, we add them together:\n\n20600 + 4082 + 700\n\nLet's compute step by step:\n\nFirst, add 20600 and 4082:\n\n20600 + 4000 = 24600\n\n24600 + 800 = 25400\n\n25400 + 600 = 26000\n\n26000 + 0 = 26000\n\nTherefore, the sum of a, b, and c is 26000.\n\nFinal answer: a = 20600, b = 4082, c = 700, sum = 26000.\n</answer>You first briefly think about the reasoning process as an internal monologue and then provide the user with the answer.\nYou first briefly think about the reasoning process as an internal monologue and then provide the user with the answer.\nProblem: ## Task 5\n\nPeter calculates the sum of three numbers $a, b$,\n\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant that provides well‑reasoned but short responses.\nYou first briefly think about the reasoning process as an internal monologue and then provide the user with the answer.\nRespond in the following format:\n\nProblem: ## Task 5\n\nPeter calculates the sum of three numbers $a, b$, and $c$.\n\nThe number $a$ is 100 greater than the difference between the numbers 50700 and 30200.\n\nThe number $b$ is the successor of seven times 583.\n\nThe number $c$ is the third part of the predecessor of 2101.\n\nGive the numbers $a, b$, and $c$ and their sum.\n\n<think>\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\nTask 5\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, Peter calculates the sum of three numbers: a, b, and c. The problem states that the number a is 100 greater than the difference between the numbers 50700 and 30200. So, we need to find the value of a first.\n\nStarting with the difference between 50700 and 30200. Let's compute that:\n\n50700 - 30200 = 20500\n\nSo, the difference is 20500. Then, a is 100 greater than this difference. Therefore, a = 20500 + 100 = 20600.\n\nNext, the number b is the successor of seven times 583. Let's compute seven times 583 first.\n\n7 * 583 = 7 * (500 + 80 + 3) = 7 * 500 + 7 * 80 + 7 * 3\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n7 * 500 = 3500\n\n7 * 80 = 560\n\n7 * 3 = 21\n\nAdding them together: 3500 + 560 + 21 = 4081\n\nSo, seven times 583 is 4081. The successor of 4081 is 4081 + 1 = 4082. Therefore, b = 4082.\n\nNow, the number c is the third part of the predecessor of 2101. Let's find the predecessor of 2101 first.\n\nThe predecessor of a number is one less than that number. So, the predecessor of 2101 is 2101 - 1 = 2100.\n\nThen, c is the third part of 2100. To find a third part, we divide 2100 by 3.\n\n2100 ÷ 3 = 700\n\nTherefore, c = 700.\n\nNow, we have all three numbers: a = 20600, b = 4082, c = 700.\n\nTo find their sum, we add them together:\n\n20600 + 4082 + 700\n\nLet's compute step by step:\n\nFirst, add 20600 and 4082:\n\n20600 + 4000 = 24600\n\n24600 + 800 = 25400\n\n25400 + 600 = 26000\n\n26000 + 0 = 26000\n\nTherefore, the sum of a, b, and c is 26000.\n\nFinal answer: a = 20600, b = 4082, c = 700, sum = 26000.\n</answer>You first briefly think about the reasoning process as an internal monologue and then provide the user with the answer.\nYou first briefly think about the reasoning process as an internal monologue and then provide the user with the answer.\nProblem: ## Task 5\n\nPeter calculates the sum of three numbers $a, b$,\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\nTask 5\n\nPeter calculates the sum of three numbers: a, b, and c.

Each child gave one nut to each of the children standing to their right. After this exchange, the girls had 25 more nuts than they originally had. We need to find out how many girls are in the row. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's visualize the row of 10 children. Let's label them from left to right as Child 1, Child 2, ..., Child 10. Each child gives one nut to each of the children to their right. So, Child 1 gives nuts to Child 2, Child 3, ..., Child 10. Child 2 gives nuts to Child 3, Child 4, ..., Child 10.

Child 10 doesn't have anyone to give nuts to, so they don't give any.\n\nNow, the total number of nuts each child has after this exchange. Let's denote the number of nuts each child originally had as N. Since there are 10 children, the total number of nuts is 10N. Each child gives one nut to each of the children to their right. So, Child 1 gives nuts to Child 2, Child 3, ..., Child 10. Child 2 gives nuts to Child 3, Child 4, ..., Child 10. Child 3 gives nuts to Child 4, Child 5, ..., Child 10.

Child 7 gives nuts to Child 8, Child 9, Child 10. Child 8 gives nuts to Child 9, Child 10. Child 9 gives nuts to Child 10. Child 10 doesn't give any.\n\nSo, each child gives nuts to the children to their right. Let's calculate how many nuts each child ends up with. Child 1 gives nuts to Child 2, Child 3, ..., Child 10. So, Child 1 gives 9 nuts (since there are 9 children to their right). Child 2 gives nuts to Child 3, Child 4, ..., Child 10. So, Child 2 gives 8 nuts.

Since each child originally had N nuts, after giving away 9 nuts each, they each have N - 9 nuts left. But the problem states that after this exchange, the girls had 25 more nuts than they originally had. Let's denote the number of girls as G and the number of boys as B. Since there are 10 children in total, G + B = 10. The total number of nuts each child has after the exchange is N - 9. The girls originally had 25 more nuts than they had after the exchange. So, the total number of nuts the girls have after the exchange is 25 more than their original total. Let's denote the original total number of nuts the girls had as G * N.

The solution set is supposed to correspond to an interval length of 1/2 on the number line. The question is asking for the value of a that satisfies this condition. Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the inequality involves square roots, so I need to consider the domain of the expressions. The expressions under the square roots must be non-negative. So, for √(x + a) to be defined, x + a ≥ 0, which implies x ≥ -a. Similarly, for √(x - a) to be defined, x - a ≥ 0, which implies x ≥ a. Therefore, the domain of the inequality is x ≥ max(a, 0). But since a is given to be positive, the domain is x ≥ a. Wait, but the problem says \"the solution set of the inequality corresponds to an interval length of 1/2 on the number line\". So, the interval length is 1/2, which means the solution set is an interval of length 1/2. So, the solution set is an interval [c, d] where d - c = 1/2. Therefore, the length of the interval is 1/2. So, the interval is [a, a + 1/2]. But the problem says \"the solution set of the inequality corresponds to an interval length of 1/2 on the number line\". So, the interval is [a, a + 1/2], and the length is 1/2. Therefore, the length is d - c = 1/2. So, d - c = 1/2. Therefore, the interval is [a, a + 1/2], and the length is 1/2. So, the interval is [a, a + 1/2], and the length is 1/2. Therefore, the length is 1/2. So, the interval is [a, a + 1/2], and the length is 1/2. Therefore, the length is 1/2. So, the interval is [a, a + 1/2], and the length is 1/2. Therefore, the interval is [a, a + 1/2], and the length is 1/2. Therefore, the interval is [a, a + 1/2], and the length is 1/2. Therefore, the interval is [a, a + 1/2], and the length is 1/2. Therefore, the interval is [a, a + 1/2], and the length is 1/2. Therefore, the interval is [a, a + 1/2], and the length is 1/2.

Let me break it down step by step. First, let's understand the information given.\n\nWe have a flower bouquet with four types of flowers: pink roses, red roses, pink carnations, and red carnations. The total number of flowers is divided into three parts: pink flowers, red flowers, and carnations. The percentages given are:\n\n- One third of the pink flowers are roses.\n- Three fourths of the red flowers are carnations.\n- Six tenths of the flowers are pink.\n\nWe need to find the percentage of the flowers that are carnations. The answer choices are given from 15% to 70%, so we need to calculate the exact percentage.\n\nLet me denote the total number of flowers as T. Then, the number of pink flowers is P, red flowers is R, pink carnations is C, and red carnations is K. So, T = P + R + C + K.\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n\n1. P = (1/3)R (since one third of the pink flowers are roses)\n2. R = (3/4)K (since three fourths of the red flowers are carnations)\n3. P = (6/10)T (since six tenths of the flowers are pink)\n\nWe need to find the percentage of flowers that are carnations, which is (C + K)/T * 100.\n\nLet me start by expressing everything in terms of T.\n\nFrom the third equation: P = (6/10)T. So, P = 0.6T.\n\nFrom the first equation: P = (1/3)R. So, R = 3P. Since P = 0.6T, then R = 3*(0.6T) = 1.8T.\n\nFrom the second equation: R = (3/4)K. So, K = (4/3)R. Since R = 1.8T, then K = (4/3)*(1.8T) = 2.4T.\n\nNow, let's find the total number of carnations. C + K = C + 2.4T.\n\nThe total number of flowers is T = P + R + C + K = 0.6T + 1.8T + C + 2.4T = (0.6 + 1.8 + 2.4)T = 4.8T.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of carnations is (C + K)/T * 100 = (C + 2.4T)/4.8T * 100.\n\nBut we need to express C in terms of T. Let's find C first.\n\nFrom the first equation: P = (1/3)R. Since P = 0.6T, then R = 3P = 3*(0.6T) = 1.8T.\n\nFrom the second equation: R = (3/4)K. Since R = 1.8T, then K = (4/3)R = (4/3)*(1.8T) = 2.4T.\n\nFrom the third equation: P = (6/10)T. Since P = 0.6T, then T = 0.6T. Wait, that seems contradictory. Let me check again.\n\nFrom the third equation: P = (6/10)T.

So, P = 0.6T.\n\nFrom the first equation: P = (1/3)R. So, R = 3P. Since P = 0.6T, then R = 3*(0.6T) = 1.8T.\n\nFrom the second equation: R = (3/4)K. So, K = (4/3)R. Since R = 1.8T, then K = (4/3)*(1.8T) = 2.4T.\n\nNow, let's find the total number of carnations. C + K = C + 2.4T.\n\nThe total number of flowers is T = P + R + C + K = 0.6T + 1.8T + C + 2.4T = (0.6 + 1.8 + 2.4)T = 4.8T.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of carnations is (C + K)/T * 100 = (C + 2.4T)/4.8T * 100.\n\nBut we need to express C in terms of T. Let's find C first.\n\nFrom the first equation: P = (1/3)R. Since P = 0.6T, then R = 3P = 3*(0.6T) = 1.8T.\n\nFrom the second equation: R = (3/4)K. Since R = 1.8T, then K = (4/3)R = (4/3)*(1.8T) = 2.4T.\n\nFrom the third equation: P = (6/10)T. Since P = 0.6T, then T = 0.6T. Wait, that seems contradictory. Let me check again.\n\nFrom the third equation: P = (6/10)T. So, P\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\n<think>\nWait, let me check the third equation again. The problem states that six tenths of the flowers are pink. So, P = (6/10)T. Since P is pink flowers, and the total flowers are T, then P = 0.6T. Then, from the first equation, P = (1/3)R. So, 0.6T = (1/3)R. Therefore, R = 1.8T. Then, from the second equation, R = (3/4)K. So, 1.8T = (3/4)K. Therefore, K = 2.4T. Then, the total number of flowers is T = P + R + C + K = 0.6T + 1.8T + C + 2.4T = 4.8T. Therefore, the total number of carnations is C + K = C + 2.4T. The percentage of carnations is (C + 2.4T)/4.8T * 100. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, let's express C in terms of T", "e71c071_correct": false}

The result is zero, so the product must equal -1. That means the product of these four terms is -1. So, the roots of this equation are the values of x where the product equals -1. Since the product is a polynomial of degree 4, there are four roots, which could be real or complex. But since we're looking for real roots, we can focus on real solutions.\n\nLet me try to factor this product. Maybe I can group the terms in pairs to see if there's a pattern. Let's take the first two terms and the last two terms:\n\n(x + 1998)(x + 2001) and (x + 1999)(x + 2000). Let me compute each pair:\n\n(x + 1998)(x + 2001) = x^2 + (1998 + 2001)x + 1998*2001 = x^2 + 3999x + 3998008\n\n(x + 1999)(x + 2000) = x^2 + (1999 + 2000)x + 1999*2000 = x^2 + 3999x + 3998000\n\nSo, the product of these two pairs is:\n\n(x^2 + 3999x + 3998008)(x^2 + 3999x + 3998000)\n\nHmm, that's a quartic polynomial. Let me denote y = x^2 + 3999x + 3998000. Then the product becomes (y + 8)(y + 10) = y^2 + 18y + 80. So, the original equation becomes:\n\n(y + 8)(y + 10) + 1 = 0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\ny^2 + 18y + 81 = 0\n\nWhich factors into (y + 9)^2 = 0\n\nTherefore, y = -9. But y = x^2 + 3999x + 3998000. So, substituting back:\n\nx^2 + 3999x + 3998000 = -9\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nx^2 + 3999x + 3998009 = 0\n\nNow, this is a quadratic equation. Let me compute the discriminant to see if it's real:\n\nD = (3999)^2 - 4*1*3998009\n\nCalculating the discriminant:\n\nD = 15992001 - 15992036 = -35\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, the quadratic equation has no real roots.

Hmm, let me start by understanding what symmetry with respect to a line means here. If two points are symmetric with respect to a line, then their midpoint must lie on that line, and the line must pass through the midpoint. So, first, I need to find the midpoint of the two points on the ellipse. Then, that midpoint must lie on the line l. Then, the line l must pass through that midpoint. So, I need to set up equations based on these conditions.\n\nLet me recall that for two points (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂) on the ellipse, the midpoint is ((x₁ + x₂)/2, (y₁ + y₂)/2). Since these points are symmetric with respect to the line l, their midpoint must satisfy the equation of the line. Also, the line l must pass through this midpoint. Therefore, the midpoint must lie on the line l, and the line l must pass through the midpoint.\n\nSo, let's denote the two points on the ellipse as (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂). Then, their midpoint is ((x₁ + x₂)/2, (y₁ + y₂)/2). Since these points are symmetric with respect to the line l, which is y = 4x + m, the midpoint must satisfy the equation of the line. Therefore, substituting the midpoint into the line equation:\n\n(y₁ + y₂)/2 = 4*(x₁ + x₂)/2 + m\n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\ny₁ + y₂ = 4(x₁ + x₂) + 2m\n\nSo, the sum of the y-coordinates of the two points is 4 times the sum of their x-coordinates plus 2m. That seems like a key equation.\n\nAdditionally, since the two points are on the ellipse, they must satisfy the ellipse equation:\n\nx₁²/4 + y₁²/3 = 1\n\nSimilarly, for the other point (x₂, y₂):\n\nx₂²/4 + y₂²/3 = 1\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1) y₁ + y₂ = 4(x₁ + x₂) + 2m\n\n2) x₁²/4 + y₁²/3 = 1\n\n3) x₂²/4 + y₂²/3 = 1\n\nOur goal is to find the range of m such that there exist two points (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂) satisfying both equations 1 and 2, and also satisfying equation 3.

From equation 1, we can solve for x₁ + x₂:\n\nx₁ + x₂ = (y₁ + y₂)/4 - m/2\n\nSimilarly, from equation 2, x₂ + x₁ = (y₂ + y₁)/4 - m/2\n\nSo, adding these two equations:\n\n2(x₁ + x₂) = (y₁ + y₂)/4 - m/2 + (y₂ + y\n\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant that provides well‑reasoned but short responses.\nYou first briefly think about the reasoning process as an internal monologue and then provide the user with the answer.\nRespond in the following format:\n\nProblem: 6.

So that's 10^4 + 1. Then, 10^2 + 1 is 1 followed by 2 zeros, plus 1. So that's 10^2 + 1. Finally, 10 + 1 is just 10. So the entire product is (10^16 + 1)(10^8 + 1)(10^4 + 1)(10^2 + 1)(10 + 1).

Compute $\\sqrt{a+b+c}$.\n\n<think>\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\n<think>\nAlright, so the problem is about a complex number ω with magnitude 2016. The key condition is that ω, ω², and λω form an equilateral triangle in the complex plane. We need to find λ in the form (a + √b)/c where a, b, c are positive integers, and b is squarefree. Then, compute √(a + b + c). Hmm, let's start by recalling some properties of equilateral triangles in the complex plane.\n\nFirst, in the complex plane, an equilateral triangle can be formed by rotating a point by 120 degrees (or 240 degrees) around another point. So, if ω is one vertex, then the other two vertices would be ω² and λω. The distance between each pair of these points should be equal. Let's denote the vertices as A, B, and C, with A = ω, B = ω², and C = λω. The distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C, and also equal to the distance between C and A.\n\nLet's compute the distance between A and B. The distance between two complex numbers z1 and z2 is |z1 - z2|. So, |ω - ω²|. Similarly, the distance between B and C is |ω² - λω|. Since these distances are equal, we can set up the equation:\n\n|ω - ω²| = |ω² - λω|\n\nLet's compute the left side first. Let's write ω as 2016e^(iθ) for some angle θ, since |ω| = 2016. Then, ω² = 2016²e^(i2θ), and λω = λ * 2016e^(iθ). So, the left side is |2016e^(iθ) - 2016²e^(i2θ)|. Let's factor out 2016:\n\n2016|e^(iθ) - 2016e^(i2θ)|\n\nSimilarly, the right side is |2016²e^(i2θ) - λω| = 2016²|e^(i2θ) - λe^(iθ)|. Let's compute the left side again:\n\n|2016e^(iθ) - 2016²e^(i2θ)| = 2016|e^(iθ) - 2016e^(i2θ)|\n\nSo, setting the two expressions equal:\n\n2016|e^(iθ) - 2016e^(i2θ)| = 2016²|e^(i2θ) - λe^(iθ)|\n\nDivide both sides by 2016:\n\n|e^(iθ) - 2016e^(i2θ)| = 2016|e^(i2θ) - λe^(iθ)|\n\nLet's denote e^(iθ) as z.

Compute $\\sqrt{a+b+c}$.\n\n<think>\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\n<think>\nAlright, so the problem is about a complex number ω with magnitude 2016. The key condition is that ω, ω², and λω form an equilateral triangle in the complex plane. We need to find λ in the form (a + √b)/c where a, b, c are positive integers, and b is squarefree. Then, compute √(a + b + c). Hmm, let's start by recalling some properties of equilateral triangles in the complex plane.\n\nFirst, in the complex plane, an equilateral triangle can be formed by rotating a point by 120 degrees (or 240 degrees) around another point. So, if ω is one vertex, then the other two vertices would be ω² and λω. The distance between each pair of these points should be equal. Let's denote the vertices as A, B, and C, with A = ω, B = ω², and C = λω. The distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C, and also equal to the distance between C and A.\n\nLet's compute the distance between A and B. The distance between two complex numbers z1 and z2 is |z1 - z2|. So, |ω - ω²|. Similarly, the distance between B and C is |ω² - λω|. Since these distances are equal, we can set up the equation:\n\n|ω - ω²| = |ω² - λω|\n\nLet's compute the left side first. Let's write ω as 2016e^(iθ) for some angle θ, since |ω| = 2016. Then, ω² = 2016²e^(i2θ), and λω = λ * 2016e^(iθ). So, the left side is |2016e^(iθ) - 2016²e^(i2θ)|. Let's factor out 2016:\n\n2016|e^(iθ) - 2016e^(i2θ)|\n\nSimilarly, the right side is |2016²e^(i2θ) - λω| = 2016²|e^(i2θ) - λe^(iθ)|. Let's compute the left side again:\n\n|2016e^(iθ) - 2016²e^(i2θ)| = 2016|e^(iθ) - 2016e^(i2θ)|\n\nSo, setting the two expressions equal:\n\n2016|e^(iθ) - 2016e^(i2θ)| = 2016²|e^(i2θ) - λe^(iθ)|\n\nDivide both sides by 2016:\n\n|e^(iθ) - 2016e^(i2θ)| = 2016|e^(i2θ) - λe^(iθ)|\n\nLet's denote e^(iθ) as z. Then, the equation becomes |z - 2016z²| = 2016|2016z² - λz|.\n\nLet's compute the magnitudes. Let's compute |z - 2016z²| and |2016z² - λz|.\n\nFirst, |z - 201\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\n<think>\nAlright, so I need to solve the equation |z - 2016z²| = 2016|2016z² - λz| where z = e^(iθ). Let me recall that |z - w| = |z - w|, so the equation is valid. Let's write z = e^(iθ) = cosθ + i sinθ. Then, z² = e^(i2θ) = cos2θ + i sin2θ. Let's compute the left side: |z - 2016z²| = |cosθ + i sinθ - 2016(cos2θ + i sin2θ)|. Let's compute the magnitude:\n\n|cosθ - 2016cos2θ| + i |sinθ - 2016sin2θ|\n\nSimilarly, the right side is |2016z² - λz| = |2016(cos2θ + i sin2θ) - λ(cosθ + i sinθ)|. Let's compute the magnitude:\n\n|2016cos2θ - λcosθ| +", "e71c071_correct": false}

Let me list all the terms again:\n\nFirst four terms: 1 -2 +3 -4 = -2\n\nNext four terms: 5 -6 +7 -6 = 0\n\nLast four terms: 5 -4 +3 -2 +1 = 3\n\nTotal: -2 + 0 + 3 = 1\n\nYes, that seems right. So the result of the expression is 1. Alright, that's the answer. Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't skip any steps. The problem is straightforward, but I think I did it correctly. The key was to group the terms in pairs to simplify the subtraction. So grouping the first four terms as 1 -2 +3 -4 gives -2, then the next four as 5 -6 +7 -6 gives 0, and the last four as 5 -4 +3 -2 +1 gives 3. Adding them up gives 1. So the answer is 1.

So, x = 1 is a vertical asymptote or a hole in the graph, depending on the value of a. If a ≠ 1, then x = 1 is a vertical asymptote.

Let me recall how that works. The operational method often involves transforming the differential equation into an algebraic equation using Laplace transforms. The idea is to take the Laplace transform of both sides of the equation, then solve for the Laplace transform of the solution, and finally take the inverse Laplace transform to get the solution in the time domain.\n\nAlright, let's start by writing down the given differential equation:\n\nx'' - x' - 20x = e^{-t}, with initial conditions x(0) = 0 and x'(0) = 4.\n\nFirst, I need to take the Laplace transform of each term. The Laplace transform of x''(t) is s²X(s) - sx(0) - x'(0), where X(s) is the Laplace transform of x(t). Similarly, the Laplace transform of x'(t) is sX(s) - x(0), and the Laplace transform of 20x(t) is 20X(s). The Laplace transform of e^{-t} is 1/(s + 1). So, applying these transformations, the equation becomes:\n\n[s²X(s) - 0 - 4] - [sX(s) - 0] - 20X(s) = 1/(s + 1)\n\nSimplifying the left side:\n\n[s²X(s) - 4] - [sX(s)] - 20X(s) = 1/(s + 1)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n[s²X(s) - sX(s) - 20X(s)] - 4 = 1/(s + 1)\n\nFactor out X(s):\n\nX(s)[s² - s - 20] - 4 = 1/(s + 1)\n\nNow, solve for X(s):\n\nX(s) = [1/(s + 1) + 4] / [s² - s - 20]\n\nSo, X(s) = [1/(s + 1) + 4] / [s² - s - 20]\n\nNow, I need to decompose this into partial fractions. Let's write the numerator as 1 + 4/(s + 1). So, X(s) = [1/(s + 1) + 4/(s + 1)] / [s² - s - 20]\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\nX(s) = [1 + 4]/[s + 1] / [s² - s - 20] = (5)/(s + 1) / [s² - s - 20]\n\nSo, X(s) = 5/(s + 1) * 1/(s² - s - 20)\n\nNow, factor the denominator s² - s - 20. Let's find two numbers that multiply to -20 and add to -1. Those numbers are -5 and 4. So, s² - s - 20 = (s - 5)(s + 4).

Solve the differential equation using the operational method: $x^{\\prime \\prime}-x^{\\prime}-20 \\cdot x=\\mathrm{e}^{-t}, x(0)=0, x^{\\prime}(0)=4$.\n\n<think>\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve this differential equation using the operational method. Let me recall how that works. The operational method often involves transforming the differential equation into an algebraic equation using Laplace transforms. The idea is to take the Laplace transform of both sides of the equation, then solve for the Laplace transform of the solution, and finally take the inverse Laplace transform to get the solution in the time domain.\n\nAlright, let's start by writing down the given differential equation:\n\nx'' - x' - 20x = e^{-t}, with initial conditions x(0) = 0 and x'(0) = 4.\n\nFirst, I need to take the Laplace transform of each term. The Laplace transform of x''(t) is s²X(s) - sx(0) - x'(0), where X(s) is the Laplace transform of x(t). Similarly, the Laplace transform of x'(t) is sX(s) - x(0), and the Laplace transform of 20x(t) is 20X(s). The Laplace transform of e^{-t} is 1/(s + 1). So, applying these transformations, the equation becomes:\n\n[s²X(s) - 0 - 4] - [sX(s) - 0] - 20X(s) = 1/(s + 1)\n\nSimplifying the left side:\n\n[s²X(s) - 4] - [sX(s)] - 20X(s) = 1/(s + 1)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n[s²X(s) - sX(s) - 20X(s)] - 4 = 1/(s + 1)\n\nFactor out X(s):\n\nX(s)[s² - s - 20] - 4 = 1/(s + 1)\n\nNow, solve for X(s):\n\nX(s) = [1/(s + 1) + 4] / [s² - s - 20]\n\nSo, X(s) = [1/(s + 1) + 4] / [s² - s - 20]\n\nNow, I need to decompose this into partial fractions. Let's write the numerator as 1 + 4/(s + 1). So, X(s) = [1/(s + 1) + 4/(s + 1)] / [s² - s - 20]\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\nX(s) = [1 + 4]/[s + 1] / [s² - s - 20] = (5)/(s + 1) / [s² - s - 20]\n\nSo, X(s) = 5/(s + 1) * 1/(s² - s - 20)\n\nNow, factor the denominator s² - s - 20. Let's find two numbers that multiply to -20 and add to -1. Those numbers are -5 and 4. So, s² - s - 20 = (s - 5)(s + 4). Therefore:\n\nX(s) = 5/(s + 1) * 1/[(s - 5)(s + 4)]\n\nNow, decompose this into partial fractions:\n\n5/(s + 1) * 1/[(s - 5)(s + 4)] = A/(s - 5) + B/(s + 4)\n\nMultiply both sides by (s - 5)(s +\n\n<answer>\n5/(s + 1) * 1/[(s - 5)(s + 4)] = A/(s - 5) + B/(s + 4)\n\nMultiply both sides by (s - 5)(s + 4):\n\n5 = A(s + 4) + B(s - 5)", "e71c071_correct": false}

First, let's recall that the perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding together twice the length and twice the width. If the original length is L and the original width is W, then the original perimeter P is 2L + 2W. Now, when the length is reduced by 10%, the new length becomes 0.9L. Similarly, when the width is reduced by 20%, the new width becomes 0.8W. The new perimeter P' would then be 2*(0.9L) + 2*(0.8W) = 1.8L + 1.6W. The problem states that the perimeter decreased by 12%, so the new perimeter is 88% of the original perimeter. Therefore, 1.8L + 1.6W = 0.88*(2L + 2W).

The sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence is given by S_n = a(1 - r^n)/(1 - r), where a is the first term and r is the common ratio.

Let me start by understanding the function f(x) first. The function is given as f(x) = (10)/(x + 1) - (sqrt(x))/3. Hmm, so f is a combination of two terms: a rational function and a square root function. The domain of f would be all real numbers except where the denominator is zero or the square root is undefined. So, x cannot be -1 (since denominator would be zero) and x must be non-negative (since square root is only defined for non-negative numbers).

Hmm, let's start by understanding the given sequence and the condition we need to satisfy.\n\nFirst, let's recall that in a constant sequence, each term is equal to the previous term. So, if {b_n} is constant, then for all n, b_{n+1} = b_n. Therefore, the ratio b_{n+2}/b_{n+1} must also be equal to 1.

But the problem states that a_n is defined recursively, so if we can find x and y such that a_{n+1} = a_n for all n, then the sequence {a_n} is constant, and hence {b_n} is constant as well.

The medians to the midpoints of the legs must lie on the lines y = 3x + 1 and y = mx + 2. We need to determine the number of different constants m for which such a triangle exists. The answer choices are from 0 to 3, with option E being more than 3.\n\nFirst, let's visualize the triangle. Since the legs are parallel to the x and y axes, the triangle is a right triangle with its legs along the x and y axes. Let's denote the right angle at the origin (0,0). The legs of the triangle are along the x and y axes, so the vertices of the triangle are at (0,0), (a,0), and (0,b), where a and b are positive real numbers. The midpoints of the legs are at (a/2, 0) and (0, b/2). The medians to these midpoints are the lines connecting the midpoints to the opposite vertices.\n\nThe median from the midpoint (a/2, 0) to the opposite vertex (0, b) is the line connecting (a/2, 0) to (0, b). Similarly, the median from the midpoint (0, b/2) to the opposite vertex (a, 0) is the line connecting (0, b/2) to (a, 0).\n\nWe are given that these medians lie on the lines y = 3x + 1 and y = mx + 2. Therefore, the equations of the medians are y = 3x + 1 and y = mx + 2. Since these medians pass through the midpoints and the opposite vertices, their equations must satisfy the coordinates of these midpoints and vertices.\n\nLet's first consider the median from (a/2, 0) to (0, b). The equation of this line is y = 3x + 1. Since this line passes through the midpoint (a/2, 0), substituting x = a/2 into the equation gives y = 3*(a/2) + 1 = (3a)/2 + 1. Therefore, the y-coordinate of the midpoint is (3a)/2 + 1. Since the midpoint is (a/2, 0), the y-coordinate of the midpoint is (3a)/2 + 1. Therefore, we have:\n\n(3a)/2 + 1 = 0\n\nSolving for a:\n\n(3a)/2 = -1\n\n3a = -2\n\na = -2/3\n\nBut a must be positive, so this is not possible. Therefore, the median from (a/2, 0) to (0, b) cannot lie on y = 3x + 1. Similarly, the median from (0, b/2) to (a, 0) cannot lie on y = mx + 2.

The medians to the midpoints of the legs must lie on the lines y = 3x + 1 and y = mx + 2. We need to determine the number of different constants m for which such a triangle exists. The answer choices are from 0 to 3, with option E being more than 3.\n\nFirst, let's visualize the triangle. Since the legs are parallel to the x and y axes, the triangle is a right triangle with its legs along the x and y axes. Let's denote the right angle at the origin (0,0). The legs of the triangle are along the x and y axes, so the vertices of the triangle are at (0,0), (a,0), and (0,b), where a and b are positive real numbers. The midpoints of the legs are at (a/2, 0) and (0, b/2). The medians to these midpoints are the lines connecting the midpoints to the opposite vertices.\n\nThe median from the midpoint (a/2, 0) to the opposite vertex (0, b) is the line connecting (a/2, 0) to (0, b). Similarly, the median from the midpoint (0, b/2) to the opposite vertex (a, 0) is the line connecting (0, b/2) to (a, 0).\n\nWe are given that these medians lie on the lines y = 3x + 1 and y = mx + 2. Therefore, the equations of the medians are y = 3x + 1 and y = mx + 2. Since these medians pass through the midpoints and the opposite vertices, their equations must satisfy the coordinates of these midpoints and vertices.\n\nLet's first consider the median from (a/2, 0) to (0, b). The equation of this line is y = 3x + 1. Since this line passes through the midpoint (a/2, 0), substituting x = a/2 into the equation gives y = 3*(a/2) + 1 = (3a)/2 + 1. Therefore, the y-coordinate of the midpoint is (3a)/2 + 1. Since the midpoint is (a/2, 0), the y-coordinate of the midpoint is (3a)/2 + 1. Therefore, we have:\n\n(3a)/2 + 1 = 0\n\nSolving for a:\n\n(3a)/2 = -1\n\n3a = -2\n\na = -2/3\n\nBut a must be positive, so this is not possible. Therefore, the median from (a/2, 0) to (0, b) cannot lie on y = 3x + 1. Similarly, the median from (0, b/2) to (a, 0) cannot lie on y = mx + 2. Therefore, there is no right triangle with legs parallel to the x and y axes, medians to the midpoints of the legs lying on y = 3x + 1 and y = mx + 2, and a positive a and b.\n\nTherefore, the number of different constants m for which such a triangle exists is 0.\n\nThe answer is A) 0.\n</answer>You are a helpful AI assistant that provides well-reasoned but short responses.

Hmm, let's start by recalling some properties of logarithms and trigonometric functions. The equation involves products of cosines equaling 1, which is interesting. Since the cosine function ranges between -1 and 1, the product of two cosines can only be 1 if both cosines are either 1 or -1. So, the equation can be broken down into two cases: either both cosines are 1, or both are -1. Let me consider each case separately.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the case where both cosines are 1.

So, I need to express t in terms of one variable and then find the possible values of t.\n\nFirst, maybe I can express a in terms of b or vice versa using the given equation. Let's try that. The equation is a² + ab + b² = 1. Let's rearrange it to solve for a²:\n\na² + ab + b² - 1 = 0\n\nHmm, this looks like a quadratic in terms of a. Let's write it as:\n\na² + ab + (b² - 1) = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in a. To solve for a, I can use the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is given by:\n\na = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)\n\nIn this case, the equation is a² + ab + (b² - 1) = 0. So, comparing coefficients:\n\na = -b\nb = b\nc = b² - 1\n\nPlugging into the quadratic formula:\n\na = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4*1*(b² - 1))] / (2*1)\na = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4b² + 4)] / 2\na = [-b ± sqrt(-3b² + 4)] / 2\n\nSo, a = [-b ± sqrt(4 - 3b²)] / 2\n\nTherefore, a = [-b ± sqrt(4 - 3b²)] / 2\n\nNow, since a is a real number, the expression under the square root must be non-negative. So, sqrt(4 - 3b²) ≥ 0. But since 4 - 3b² is always non-negative (because 4 is positive and 3b² is non-negative), the square root is always real. So, the expression under the square root is always non-negative, which is good.\n\nBut we need to consider the discriminant of the quadratic equation. The discriminant D is b² - 4ac = b² - 4*(1)*(b² - 1) = b² - 4b² + 4 = -3b² + 4. For real solutions, D must be ≥ 0.

We need to find the number of cows. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's define variables. Let's say there are x cows and y chickens. The total number of heads would be x + y, since each animal has one head. The total number of legs would be 4x (for cows) plus 2y (for chickens). The problem states that the number of legs is 14 more than twice the number of heads. So, if we let H be the number of heads and L be the number of legs, then the equation would be L = 2H + 14.\n\nNow, substituting the expressions for H and L into this equation. The number of heads is x + y, and the number of legs is 4x + 2y. So, 4x + 2y = 2(x + y) + 14. Let me simplify that equation.\n\nFirst, expand the right side: 2(x + y) is 2x + 2y. So, 4x + 2y = 2x + 2y + 14. Now, subtract 2x + 2y from both sides to get all terms on one side:\n\n4x + 2y - 2x - 2y = 14\n\nSimplify: 2x = 14. So, 2x = 14, which means x = 7. Therefore, the number of cows is 7.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, option B is 7. So, the answer should be B.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me substitute x = 7 back into the original equation to verify.\n\nNumber of heads: x + y = 7 + y.\n\nNumber of legs: 4x + 2y = 4*7 + 2y = 28 + 2y.\n\nAccording to the problem, legs = 2*heads + 14. So, 28 + 2y = 2*(7 + y) + 14. Let's compute the right side: 2*(7 + y) is 14 + 2y, so 14 + 2y + 14 = 28 + 2y. That matches the left side. So, the equation holds true. Therefore, x = 7 is correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of cows is 7, which corresponds to option B.\n\nFinal answer: $\\boxed{B}$.\nYou are a helpful AI assistant that provides well-reasoned but short responses.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the expression x²_i - x_ix_j is not divisible by 1111 for any i ≠ j. That means that for any two distinct indices i and j, the value of x²_i - x_ix_j should not be a multiple of 1111. So, for each pair (i, j), the value x²_i - x_ix_j must leave a remainder when divided by 1111. Therefore, the set of all such values for all pairs (i, j) must not contain 0 modulo 1111. That is, the set {x²_i - x_ix_j mod 1111 | i ≠ j} must be a subset of {1, 2, ..., 1110}.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the maximum N such that there exist integers x₁, ..., xₙ satisfying this condition. To maximize N, we need to ensure that for any two distinct indices i and j, the value x²_i - x_ix_j is not divisible by 1111. Therefore, the set of all such values must be as large as possible.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Since we need to ensure that for any two distinct indices, the difference is not divisible by 1111, we can consider the set of all possible differences x²_i - x_ix_j modulo 1111. The key here is that each difference is a quadratic form in x_i and x_j. Since x_i and x_j are integers, the possible values of x²_i - x_ix_j can be any integer modulo 1111, but we need to ensure that for any two distinct indices, the difference is not divisible by 1111.\n\nTherefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the maximum number of distinct quadratic residues modulo 1111 such that no two are congruent modulo 1111. In other words, we need to find the maximum number of distinct quadratic residues modulo 1111, where two residues are considered the same if their difference is divisible by 1111.\n\nTo solve this, I need to understand the structure of quadratic residues modulo 1111. Quadratic residues modulo a prime p are numbers that can be expressed as x² mod p for some integer x. The number of quadratic residues modulo p is (p + 1)/2 if p ≡ 1 mod 4, and (p - 1)/2 if p ≡ 3 mod 4. Since 1111 is 1111 = 37 * 31, which is 37 ≡ 1 mod 4 and 31 ≡ 3 mod 4. Therefore, 1111 ≡ 1 mod 4, so the number of quadratic residues modulo 1111 is (1111 + 1)/2 = 556.\n\nHowever, we need to ensure that no two quadratic residues are congruent modulo 1111. So, the maximum number of distinct quadratic residues modulo 1111 is 556.

For what greatest value of $n$ will it be able to do this?\n\n<think>\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\nAlright, so the problem is about a flea jumping along the number line starting from the origin. Each jump must be at least n units long, and the flea wants to visit every integer point between 0 and 2013 exactly once. The question is asking for the greatest possible value of n that allows this. Hmm, let's think about how this works.\n\nFirst, the flea starts at 0. To visit every integer point from 0 up to 2013 exactly once, it must make a series of jumps. Each jump must be at least n units long, so the total distance covered by all jumps must be at least 2013 units. But since the flea starts at 0, the first jump must be at least n units. Then, after that, the next jump must be at least n units again, and so on. So, the total distance covered is the sum of all these jumps, which must be at least 2013. But since each jump is at least n, the total distance is at least n multiplied by the number of jumps. Therefore, the number of jumps must be at least 2013 divided by n. But the number of jumps must be an integer, so the number of jumps is at least [2013 / n], where [ ] denotes the floor function. So, the total distance is at least n * [2013 / n] = 2013. But wait, that's not necessarily true. Because the flea can make jumps of length n, but the total distance is the sum of all jumps. So, the total distance is the sum of [2013 / n] jumps, each of length n. Therefore, the total distance is [2013 / n] * n = 2013. So, 2013 must be equal to [2013 / n] * n. But since [2013 / n] is the integer part of 2013 / n, which is the largest integer less than or equal to 2013 / n, then [2013 / n] * n is at least 2013, but since [2013 / n] is an integer, the total distance is exactly 2013. Therefore, the total distance is exactly 2013, which means that the number of jumps is [2013 / n], and each jump is exactly n. So, the total distance is n * [2013 / n] = 2013. Therefore, 2013 = n * [2013 / n], which simplifies to 2013 = 2013, which is true. Therefore, the total distance is exactly 2013, so the number of jumps is [2013 / n], and each jump is exactly n. Therefore, the total distance is n * [2013 / n] = 2013. Therefore, 2013 = n * [2013 / n], which simplifies to 2013 = 2013, which is true. Therefore, the total distance is exactly 2013, so the number of jumps is [2013 / n], and each jump is exactly n. Therefore, the total distance is n * [2013 / n] = 2013. Therefore, 2013 = n * [2\n\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant that provides well‑reasoned but short responses.\nYou first briefly think about the reasoning process as an internal monologue and then provide the user with the answer.\nRespond in the following format:\n\nProblem: 3.

Therefore, 2013 = n * [2\n\n<answer>\nThe greatest value of n that allows the flea to visit all integer points between 0 and 2013 exactly once is 1. Since each jump must be at least n units long, and the flea needs to visit all points from 0 to 2013, the total distance covered must be at least 2013 units. If n is 1, then each jump is 1 unit, so the total distance is 2013 jumps of 1 unit each, which is exactly 2013 units. Therefore, the flea can make 2013 jumps of 1 unit each, visiting each integer point from 0 to 2013 exactly once. If n were any larger, the total distance would exceed 2013, which would require more jumps, but since each jump must be at least n, the number of jumps would have to be at least 2013 / n, which would result in a total distance greater than 2013. Therefore, the greatest possible value of n is 1. The answer is 1.You are a helpful AI assistant that provides well-reasoned but short responses. When", "e71c071_correct": false}

We need to find the sum of S. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the problem is asking. We have a set S of numbers from 1 to 15, and we need to make sure that for any two subsets of S, their sums are unique. That means if we take any two different subsets, their sums should be different. Also, among all such sets, we want the one with the largest sum. So, we need to find the largest possible sum of a set S that satisfies these conditions.\n\nTo approach this, maybe we can think about the structure of such a set. If we can find a set where every possible sum of two disjoint subsets is unique, then that set will have the property we need. But how can we construct such a set?\n\nLet's consider the simplest case: a set with only one element. If S has only one element, say 1, then the sum of any two disjoint subsets would be 1 + 1 = 2, which is unique. But the problem states that the sums of any two disjoint subsets must be different. So, if S has only one element, then the sum of any two subsets would be 2, which is the same. Therefore, this set doesn't satisfy the condition. So, S must have at least two elements.\n\nLet's try with two elements. Let's take S = {1, 2}. The possible sums of disjoint subsets are:\n\n- 1 (from subset {1})\n- 2 (from subset {2})\n- 1 + 2 = 3 (from subset {1, 2})\n\nSo, the sums are 1, 2, and 3. All three are different.

The question is asking for more three-digit numbers where the sum of the digits equals the number formed by the first two digits. Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, let's recall that a three-digit number can be represented as ABC, where A, B, and C are its digits. The sum of the digits is A + B + C. The number formed by the first two digits is AB, which is 10A + B. The problem states that the sum of the digits (A + B + C) is equal to the number formed by the first two digits (10A + B). So, we can set up the equation:\n\nA + B + C = 10A + B\n\nLet me simplify this equation. Subtract A + B from both sides:\n\nC = 10A + B - A - B\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nC = 9A\n\nSo, the third digit C must be 9 times the first digit A. That means A can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since it's a three-digit number, A can't be 0), and C will be 9 times A. Then, the second digit B can be any digit from 0 to 9. So, the number is in the form ABC, where A is a digit from 1 to 9, B is a digit from 0 to 9, and C is 9A.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"more three-digit numbers with this property\". So, we need to find all such numbers. Let's list them out.\n\nStarting with A = 1: C = 9*1 = 9. Then B can be 0-9. So, numbers are 109, 119, 129, ..., 199. That's 10 numbers.\n\nA = 2: C = 9*2 = 18. But 18 is a two-digit number, so this is invalid.\n\nA = 3: C = 9*3 = 27. Again, 27 is a two-digit number, invalid.\n\nA = 4: C = 9*4 = 36. 36 is a two-digit number, invalid.\n\nA = 5: C = 9*5 = 45. 45 is a two-digit number, invalid.\n\nA = 6: C = 9*6 = 54. 54 is a two-digit number, invalid.\n\nA = 7: C = 9*7 = 63. 63 is a two-digit number, invalid.\n\nA = 8: C = 9*8 = 72. 72 is a two-digit number, invalid.\n\nA = 9: C = 9*9 = 81. 81 is a two-digit number, invalid.\n\nSo, for A from 1 to 9, there are no valid numbers. Therefore, there are no three-digit numbers where the sum of the digits equals the number formed by the first two digits. Wait, but the problem says \"more three-digit numbers with this property\". Hmm, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again.\n\nThe problem says: \"Can you name more three-digit numbers with this property?\".

The campaign allows you to get one full bottle for every four empty ones. The question is asking how many liters of milk a person can get with 43 empty bottles. The options are from 11 to 15 liters. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many full bottles I can get from the 43 empty ones. Since each exchange gives me one full bottle for every four empty ones, I can calculate the number of exchanges by dividing the total empty bottles by 4. Let me do that calculation.\n\n43 divided by 4 is 10 with a remainder of 3. So, 43 empty bottles can be exchanged for 10 full bottles. That's straightforward. Now, the question is asking how many liters of milk that is. Since each full bottle is 1 liter, 10 full bottles would be 10 liters. But wait, the answer choices are from 11 to 15 liters. So, 10 liters is not one of the options. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in my calculation.\n\nWait, no. Let me check again. If I have 43 empty bottles, and each exchange gives me 1 full bottle, then 43 divided by 4 is 10 with a remainder of 3. So, 10 exchanges would give me 10 full bottles. Each full bottle is 1 liter, so 10 liters. But 10 is not in the options. So, maybe I need to consider that after exchanging 10 bottles, I have 3 empty ones left. Then, I can exchange those 3 empty bottles for 0.75 full bottles (since 3 divided by 4 is 0.75). Then, I can exchange those 0.75 full bottles for 0.1875 more full bottles. Wait, but 0.1875 is less than 1, so that's not possible. So, maybe I need to consider that after exchanging 10 bottles, I have 3 empty ones left. Then, I can exchange those 3 empty bottles for 0.75 full bottles. Then, I can exchange those 0.75 full bottles for 0.1875 more full bottles. But 0.1875 is less than 1, so that's not possible. So, maybe I need to consider that after exchanging 10 bottles, I have 3 empty ones left. Then, I can exchange those 3 empty bottles for 0.75 full bottles.

The campaign allows you to get one full bottle for every four empty ones. The question is asking how many liters of milk a person can get with 43 empty bottles. The options are from 11 to 15 liters. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many full bottles I can get from the 43 empty ones. Since each exchange gives me one full bottle for every four empty ones, I can calculate the number of exchanges by dividing the total empty bottles by 4. Let me do that calculation.\n\n43 divided by 4 is 10 with a remainder of 3. So, 43 empty bottles can be exchanged for 10 full bottles. That's straightforward. Now, the question is asking how many liters of milk that is. Since each full bottle is 1 liter, 10 full bottles would be 10 liters. But wait, the answer choices are from 11 to 15 liters. So, 10 liters is not one of the options. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in my calculation.\n\nWait, no. Let me check again. If I have 43 empty bottles, and each exchange gives me 1 full bottle, then 43 divided by 4 is 10 with a remainder of 3. So, 10 exchanges would give me 10 full bottles. Each full bottle is 1 liter, so 10 liters. But 10 is not in the options. So, maybe I need to consider that after exchanging 10 bottles, I have 3 empty ones left. Then, I can exchange those 3 empty bottles for 0.75 full bottles (since 3 divided by 4 is 0.75). Then, I can exchange those 0.75 full bottles for 0.1875 more full bottles. Wait, but 0.1875 is less than 1, so that's not possible. So, maybe I need to consider that after exchanging 10 bottles, I have 3 empty ones left. Then, I can exchange those 3 empty bottles for 0.75 full bottles. Then, I can exchange those 0.75 full bottles for 0.1875 more full bottles. But 0.1875 is less than 1, so that's not possible. So, maybe I need to consider that after exchanging 10 bottles, I have 3 empty ones left. Then, I can exchange those 3 empty bottles for 0.75 full bottles. Then, I can exchange those 0.75 full bottles for 0.1875 more full bottles. But 0.1875 is less than 1, so that's not possible.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a triangle, the medians are the lines from each vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. The centroid, which is the intersection point of the medians, divides each median into a ratio of 2:1. So, the centroid is two-thirds of the way along each median from the vertex.\n\nGiven that two medians are 18 and 24, and they are perpendicular, I need to find the length of the third median. Since the centroid divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, the centroid is located at 12 units from the vertex where the 18-unit median ends, and 16 units from the vertex where the 24-unit median ends. But since the centroid is the same for all three medians, maybe I can use that to find the length of the third median.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the length of a median in a triangle. The formula for the length of a median from vertex A to side BC is (1/2) * sqrt(2b² + 2c² - a²), where a, b, c are the sides opposite vertices A, B, C respectively. But since I don't know the sides, maybe I can use the fact that the centroid divides each median in a 2:1 ratio.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use coordinate geometry. Let me try that. Let me place the triangle in a coordinate system. Let's say the triangle is ABC, with A at the origin (0,0), B at (2a, 0), and C at (2b, 2c). Then, the centroid G would be at (a, c). The medians from A and B would be from (0,0) to (a, c) and from (2a, 0) to (a, c), respectively. The third median would be from C to the midpoint of AB, which is (a, 0). So, the third median is from (2b, 2c) to (a, 0).\n\nBut since the medians are perpendicular, the centroid G is located at (a, c). The centroid divides each median in a 2:1 ratio. So, the centroid is two-thirds of the way along each median from the vertex. Therefore, the centroid is located at (12, 6) if the 18-unit median is from A to (12, 6) and the 24-unit median is from B to (12, 6). But since the centroid is the same for all three medians, maybe I can set up equations based on the coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the centroid divides each median in a 2:1 ratio. Let me denote the length of the third median as m. Then, the centroid is located at (12, 6) if the 18-unit median is from A to (12, 6) and the 24-unit median is from B to (12, 6).

We have triangle ABC with point M on BC such that BM:MC = 3:7. The bisector BL of triangle ABC intersects AM at point P, forming a 90-degree angle. We need to find the ratio of the area of triangle ABP to the area of quadrilateral LPMC, and then find the angle CBL given that MT:TC = 1:6 and LT is perpendicular to BC.\n\nFirst, let's note that since BM:MC = 3:7, point M divides BC into segments BM = 3k and MC = 7k for some k. Since BM + MC = BC, we can find BC = 10k. Let me denote BC = 10k, so BM = 3k and MC = 7k.\n\nNow, the bisector BL of triangle ABC intersects AM at point P, forming a 90-degree angle. This suggests that BL is the angle bisector and also the altitude from B to AM. Since BL is the angle bisector, it divides angle ABC into two equal parts. Also, since BL is the altitude, it's perpendicular to AM. Therefore, triangle ABP is a right triangle with right angle at P, and BL is the altitude.\n\nGiven that BL is the angle bisector and altitude, we can use the Angle Bisector Theorem and the properties of right triangles. Let me recall that in a triangle, the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides. So, in triangle ABC, the angle bisector BL divides BC into segments BL and LC such that BL/LC = AB/AC.\n\nBut since we don't know the lengths of AB and AC, we need to find a way to relate these lengths using the given information. However, since we are dealing with areas and ratios, perhaps we can use coordinate geometry or similar triangles.\n\nAlternatively, since BL is the angle bisector and altitude, we can use the fact that in a right triangle, the altitude to the hypotenuse is the geometric mean of the two segments it creates.

The problem is asking for the smallest c that works for all such sequences. Hmm, let's start by understanding what a \"good sequence\" is. It's a sequence where each term is at least as large as the previous one, starting at 1. So, the sequence is non-decreasing and starts at 1. The sum of x_i squared over x_{i+1} must be bounded by c for all n. So, we need to find the maximum possible value of this sum over all such sequences, and then that maximum value divided by 2 would be the answer, since the sum is over n from 0 to infinity. But since the sequence is non-decreasing, the sum over n from 0 to infinity would be the sum over n from 0 to infinity of x_n^2 / x_{n+1}. So, the problem reduces to finding the maximum value of x_n^2 / x_{n+1} over all non-decreasing sequences starting at 1, and then dividing by 2. That seems like a good approach.\n\nLet me think. If I can find the maximum value of x_n^2 / x_{n+1} for a non-decreasing sequence starting at 1, then that maximum value divided by 2 would be the answer. So, I need to find the supremum of x_n^2 / x_{n+1} over all non-decreasing sequences starting at 1. Then, the answer is 2 times that supremum. But how do I find that supremum?\n\nFirst, let's consider the case where the sequence is constant. If the sequence is constant, then x_n = 1 for all n. Then, x_n^2 / x_{n+1} = 1 / 1 = 1. So, the supremum is 1. But that's a trivial case. So, the supremum must be greater than 1. So, the answer is 2 times the supremum. So, the problem reduces to finding the supremum of x_n^2 / x_{n+1} over all non-decreasing sequences starting at 1, and then multiplying by 2.\n\nBut how do I find that supremum? Let me think. Suppose I have a non-decreasing sequence starting at 1. Let's denote the sequence as x_0 = 1, x_1 ≥ x_0, x_2 ≥ x_1, and so on. Then, x_n^2 / x_{n+1} is the ratio of the square of the current term to the next term. So, we need to maximize this ratio over all possible non-decreasing sequences starting at 1.\n\nLet me try to model this. Let's consider the ratio x_n^2 / x_{n+1} as a function of n. Let's denote this function as f(n) = x_n^2 / x_{n+1}. Then, we need to find the maximum value of f(n) over all non-decreasing sequences starting at 1.\n\nBut how does f(n) behave? Let's see.

The problem is to find the smallest constant c such that there exists a \"good sequence\" {x_n} satisfying the given conditions.

The key insight is that the maximum value of x_n^2 / x_{n+1} over all non-decreasing sequences starting at 1 is 1, which occurs when the sequence is constant. Therefore, the supremum of x_n^2 / x_{n+1} over all such sequences is 1. Hence, the maximum value of the sum is 1, so the answer is 2 times that, which is 2. Therefore, the smallest constant c is 2.

Let's denote the distance as D km.\n\nWhen she flies at 50 km/h, she is 2 hours late. Therefore, the time taken at 50 km/h is D / 50 hours. Since she is 2 hours late, the actual time she needs to arrive is D / 50 hours + 2 hours. Since she must arrive exactly at midnight, the total time available is 12 hours minus the time taken at 50 km/h. Let's denote the total time available as T hours. So, T = 12 - (D / 50 + 2). Therefore, T = 12 - D / 50 - 2 = 10 - D / 50.\n\nAlternatively, when she flies at 150 km/h, she is 2 hours early. So, the time taken at 150 km/h is D / 150 hours. Since she is 2 hours early, the actual time she needs to arrive is D / 150 hours - 2 hours. Therefore, T = 12 - (D / 150 - 2) = 12 - D / 150 + 2 = 14 - D / 150.\n\nSince both expressions represent the total time T, we can set them equal to each other:\n\n10 - D / 50 = 14 - D / 150\n\nLet's solve for D:\n\nFirst, let's find a common denominator for the fractions. The denominators are 50 and 150. The least common multiple of 50 and 150 is 150. So, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n10 - (3D / 150) = 14 - D / 150\n\nSubtract 10 from both sides:\n\n- (3D / 150) = 4 - D / 150\n\nMultiply both sides by 150 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n-3D = 600 - D\n\nAdd D to both sides:\n\n-2D = 600\n\nDivide both sides by -2:\n\nD = -600 / -2 = 300 km\n\nSo, the total distance D is 300 km.\n\nNow, we need to find the time she took off. Let's denote the time she took off as T hours. The total time available is 12 hours minus the time taken at 50 km/h. So, T = 12 - (D / 50 + 2). Since D is 300 km, we can substitute:\n\nT = 12 - (300 / 50 + 2) = 12 - (6 + 2) = 12 - 8 = 4 hours\n\nTherefore, she took off at 4 hours before midnight, which is 8:00 AM.\n\nNow, we need to find the speed she flew at. Let's denote the speed as S km/h. The time taken at this speed is D / S hours. Since she took off at 4 hours before midnight, the time taken is 4 hours. Therefore, D / S = 4.

What is the maximum number of prime numbers Tanya can use?\n\n<think>\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\nTo determine the maximum number of prime numbers Tanya can use in the examples of the form *+*=*, where each * is replaced with a different natural number, we need to consider how to maximize the number of primes used. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the equation. Each * is replaced with a different natural number, so there are 20 different numbers used in total. The equation is * + * = *. Therefore, the sum of two numbers equals another number. Since all numbers are natural numbers, the sum of two natural numbers can be any natural number, but the equation requires that the sum is equal to one of the numbers. Therefore, the equation can be rewritten as:\n\na + b = c, where a, b, c are distinct natural numbers.\n\nOur goal is to maximize the number of primes among a, b, c. To do this, we need to ensure that as many of a, b, c as possible are prime numbers. However, since a, b, c are distinct natural numbers, if we use a prime number, we can't use another prime number for a and b, because then c would be a prime number, which would require a third prime number, but we only have two primes left. Therefore, the maximum number of primes we can use is 2, because if we use three primes, we would need a third prime for c, but we only have two primes left. Therefore, the maximum number of primes we can use is 2.\n\nTo verify, let's consider an example. Suppose we use two primes, say 2 and 3. Then, the equation becomes 2 + 3 = 5. Here, 2 and 3 are primes, and 5 is also a prime. Therefore, we have used three primes. However, if we use three primes, say 2, 3, and 5, then the equation would be 2 + 3 = 5, which is correct. But since we are using three primes, which is more than two, this is not possible. Therefore, the maximum number of primes we can use is 2.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of prime numbers Tanya can use is 2.\n\n</answer>\n\nThe answer is 2. Tanya can use a maximum of 2 prime numbers in the examples of the form *+*=*, where each * is replaced with a different natural number. Therefore, the maximum number of prime numbers she can use is 2.You are a helpful AI assistant.

Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, since the boxes are different, the order in which we place the balls into the boxes matters. This is a classic problem of distributing identical objects into distinct boxes, which can be solved using the stars and bars method. However, in this case, the balls are not identical, so we need to consider the different color combinations.\n\nThe key here is that some boxes can contain balls of different colors. This means that the distribution can have multiple colors in a single box. For example, a box could have all white balls, all red balls, all yellow balls, or a mix of colors. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to partitioning the total number of balls into three boxes with the possibility of having multiple colors in a single box.\n\nLet me break this down. We have 3 white balls, 4 red balls, and 5 yellow balls. The total number of balls is 3 + 4 + 5 = 12. We need to distribute these into three boxes, allowing some boxes to have multiple colors.\n\nFirst, let's consider the possible distributions of colors. Since we have three boxes, the maximum number of colors in any box is 3 (all white), 4 (all red), or 5 (all yellow). However, the total number of balls is 12, so the maximum number of colors in any box is 12 / 3 = 4. Therefore, the possible distributions of colors are:\n\n1. All three boxes have the same color. For example, all white, all red, or all yellow.\n2. Two boxes have one color, and one box has another color. For example, two boxes have all white, one box has all red, and one box has all yellow.\n3. One box has one color, and two boxes have another color. For example, one box has all white, one box has all red, and one box has all yellow.\n4. All three boxes have different colors. For example, one box has all white, one box has all red, and one box has all yellow.\n\nHowever, since the balls are identical within each color, the order in which we place the balls into the boxes does not matter. Therefore, the problem reduces to partitioning the total number of balls into three boxes with the possibility of having multiple colors in a single box.\n\nLet me formalize this. Let's denote the number of white balls in the three boxes as w1, w2, w3, the number of red balls as r1, r2, r3, and the number of yellow balls as y1, y2, y3. The total number of balls is 3w + 4r + 5y = 12. We need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to this equation where w1 + w2 + w3 = 3, r1 + r2 + r3 = 4, and y1 + y2 + y3 = 5, with the possibility of having multiple colors in a single box.\n\nThis is a classic problem of distributing identical objects into distinct boxes with repetition allowed. The number of solutions is given by the stars and bars formula, which is C(n + k - 1, k - 1), where n is the total number of objects and k is the number of boxes.

There aren't three students who are all friends with each other. We need to find the maximum possible value of k. Hmm, let me think. So, we have a graph here where each student is a vertex, and each friendship is an edge. The graph is simple, meaning no loops or multiple edges between the same two students. Also, the graph is triangle-free, meaning there are no three students who are all friends with each other. We need to find the largest possible k such that such a graph exists.\n\nFirst, let's recall some graph theory concepts. In a triangle-free graph, the maximum number of edges is achieved by a bipartite graph. A bipartite graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that no two vertices within the same set are adjacent. The maximum number of edges in a triangle-free graph is equal to the product of the sizes of the two sets. So, if the graph is bipartite with sets of sizes a and b, then the number of edges is a*b. But in our case, the graph is not necessarily bipartite. However, since the graph is triangle-free, the maximum number of edges is still a*b, but we need to check if such a graph exists with 2021 students.\n\nLet me try to model this. Let's denote the number of students as n = 2021. Each student has exactly k friends. So, the degree of each vertex is k. The total number of edges in the graph is the sum of the degrees divided by 2, since each edge is counted twice. So, the total number of edges is (2021*k)/2. But we also know that the graph is triangle-free. So, we need to find the maximum k such that there exists a graph with 2021 vertices, each of degree k, and no three vertices forming a triangle.\n\nTo approach this, let's consider the Turán's theorem. Turán's theorem gives the maximum number of edges in a graph that does not contain a complete subgraph of size t. In our case, we want a triangle-free graph, so we need to find the maximum number of edges in a graph with 2021 vertices that does not contain a triangle. The maximum number of edges in a triangle-free graph with n vertices is (n-1)(n-2)/2. Let me check if this is possible.\n\nIf we have a triangle-free graph with 2021 vertices, then the maximum number of edges is (2021-1)(2021-2)/2 = 2020*2019/2. Let's compute that: 2020*2019 = 2020*(2000 + 19) = 2020*2000 + 2020*19 = 4040000 + 38180 = 4078180. Divided by 2 gives 2039090. So, the maximum number of edges in a triangle-free graph with 2021 vertices is 2039090. But we need to check if this is possible with each vertex having degree k.\n\nIf each vertex has degree k, then the total number of edges is (2021*k)/2.

When they run in the same direction, A catches up with B after 3 hours. When they run in opposite directions, they meet after 2 hours. We need to find the ratio of their speeds. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's recall that when two objects are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is the difference between their speeds. So, if A is running faster than B, the relative speed is A's speed minus B's speed. Conversely, if they are moving in opposite directions, the relative speed is the sum of their speeds. That makes sense because when moving in the same direction, the faster one is closing the gap, so the relative speed is negative. But when moving in opposite directions, they are moving towards each other, so the relative speed is positive.\n\nGiven that A catches up with B after 3 hours when running in the same direction, that means in 3 hours, A has covered the distance that B has run plus the initial distance between them. Similarly, when they run in opposite directions, they meet after 2 hours, so in 2 hours, the sum of their speeds equals the distance between them. Let me try to formalize this.\n\nLet's denote the speed of A as v_A and the speed of B as v_B. The initial distance between them is some value, which I'll call d. When they run in the same direction, the relative speed is v_A - v_B. Since A catches up in 3 hours, the distance covered by A in 3 hours is equal to the initial distance plus the distance B has run in 3 hours. So, 3*(v_A - v_B) = d + 3*v_B. Wait, but actually, the distance covered by A in 3 hours is 3*(v_A - v_B) = d + 3*v_B. Wait, no. Wait, when they run in the same direction, the relative speed is v_A - v_B. So, in 3 hours, the distance covered by A is 3*(v_A - v_B) = d + 3*v_B. But the distance covered by B in 3 hours is 3*v_B. Therefore, the initial distance d is equal to 3*(v_A - v_B) - 3*v_B. Let me write that out:\n\nd = 3*(v_A - v_B) - 3*v_B\n\nSimilarly, when they run in opposite directions, the relative speed is v_A + v_B. Since they meet after 2 hours, the distance covered by A in 2 hours is equal to the distance covered by B in 2 hours, which is 2*(v_A + v_B) = d + 2*v_A. Wait, no. Wait, when they run in opposite directions, the relative speed is v_A + v_B. So, in 2 hours, the distance covered by A is 2*(v_A + v_B) = d + 2*v_A.

The sequence is given as 8 times (-1/3) to the power of (n-1). Let me start by recalling how to find the sum of a geometric series.\n\nA geometric series has the form a + ar + ar² + ... + ar^(n-1), where a is the first term and r is the common ratio. The sum S_n of the first n terms is given by S_n = a(1 - r^n)/(1 - r), provided that r ≠ 1. In this case, the first term a is 8*(-1/3)^0 = 8, and the common ratio r is -1/3. So, plugging these into the formula, we get:\n\nS_n = 8(1 - (-1/3)^n)/(1 - (-1/3)) = 8(1 - (-1/3)^n)/(4/3) = 8*(3/4)*(1 - (-1/3)^n) = 6*(1 - (-1/3)^n)\n\nSo, S_n = 6 - 6*(-1/3)^n\n\nNow, the problem requires that |S_n - 6| < 1/125. Let me compute S_n - 6:\n\nS_n - 6 = [6 - 6*(-1/3)^n] - 6 = -6*(-1/3)^n\n\nTherefore, |S_n - 6| = |-6*(-1/3)^n| = 6*(-1/3)^n\n\nWe need this to be less than 1/125. So, 6*(-1/3)^n < 1/125\n\nLet me solve this inequality for n. First, divide both sides by 6:\n\n(-1/3)^n < 1/750\n\nNow, since (-1/3)^n is always negative for n > 0, but here it's positive, so we can take the reciprocal of both sides.

Let's rewrite the inequality:\n\n3^n > 750\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest integer n such that 3^n > 750.

The sequence is given as 8 times (-1/3) to the power of (n-1). Let me start by recalling how to find the sum of a geometric series.\n\nA geometric series has the form a + ar + ar² + ... + ar^(n-1), where a is the first term and r is the common ratio. The sum S_n of the first n terms is given by S_n = a(1 - r^n)/(1 - r), provided that r ≠ 1. In this case, the first term a is 8*(-1/3)^0 = 8, and the common ratio r is -1/3. So, plugging these into the formula, we get:\n\nS_n = 8(1 - (-1/3)^n)/(1 - (-1/3)) = 8(1 - (-1/3)^n)/(4/3) = 8*(3/4)*(1 - (-1/3)^n) = 6*(1 - (-1/3)^n)\n\nSo, S_n = 6 - 6*(-1/3)^n\n\nNow, the problem requires that |S_n - 6| < 1/125. Let me compute S_n - 6:\n\nS_n - 6 = [6 - 6*(-1/3)^n] - 6 = -6*(-1/3)^n\n\nTherefore, |S_n - 6| = |-6*(-1/3)^n| = 6*(-1/3)^n\n\nWe need this to be less than 1/125. So, 6*(-1/3)^n < 1/125\n\nLet me solve this inequality for n. First, divide both sides by 6:\n\n(-1/3)^n < 1/750\n\nNow, since (-1/3)^n is always negative for n > 0, but here it's positive, so we can take the reciprocal of both sides. However, since we're dealing with absolute values, we can ignore the negative sign and just divide by 6:\n\n(-1/3)^n < 1/750\n\nTaking the reciprocal of both sides (which reverses the inequality):\n\n(-3)^n > 750\n\nBut since (-3)^n is always positive for even n and negative for odd n, but here it's positive, so we can ignore the negative sign.

First, let's tackle the first inequality: √(x - 1) < 1. To solve this, I need to consider the domain of the square root function. The expression inside the square root must be non-negative, so x - 1 ≥ 0. That gives me x ≥ 1. So, the domain of the inequality is x ≥ 1. Now, since we have a square root on the left side, the inequality is strict, meaning that the square root is less than 1, not equal to 1. Therefore, the solution to the inequality is all x in the domain where √(x - 1) < 1. Let me write that down: x ≥ 1 and √(x - 1) < 1. Since the square root is less than 1, squaring both sides would preserve the inequality, but we have to be careful because squaring can introduce extraneous solutions. So, squaring both sides gives x - 1 < 1, which simplifies to x < 2. But we also have the domain restriction x ≥ 1. So, combining these two conditions, the solution is 1 ≤ x < 2. Let me check if this is correct. If x is in [1, 2), then √(x - 1) is indeed less than 1, since √(1 - 1) = 0 and √(2 - 1) = 1. So, the solution is x ∈ [1, 2). That seems right.\n\nNow, moving on to the second inequality: √(2x - 3) ≤ √(x - 1). Again, the domain of the square roots must be non-negative. So, both expressions inside the square roots must be ≥ 0. Therefore, 2x - 3 ≥ 0 and x - 1 ≥ 0. Solving these inequalities: 2x - 3 ≥ 0 gives x ≥ 3/2, and x - 1 ≥ 0 gives x ≥ 1. So, the domain is x ≥ 3/2. Now, since we have square roots on both sides, the inequality is non-strict, meaning that the square roots are less than or equal to each other. Therefore, the solution is all x in the domain where √(2x - 3) ≤ √(x - 1). Let me square both sides to eliminate the square roots. Squaring both sides gives (2x - 3) ≤ (x - 1). Let me solve this inequality. Subtract x from both sides: x - 3 ≤ -1. Then add 3 to both sides: x ≤ 2. But we also have the domain restriction x ≥ 3/2. So, combining these two conditions, the solution is 3/2 ≤ x ≤ 2. Let me check if this is correct. If x is in [3/2, 2], then √(2x - 3) is less than or equal to √(x - 1). Let's take x = 3/2. Then √(2*(3/2) - 3) = √(3 - 3) = √0 = 0. And √(3/2 - 1) = √(1/2) ≈ 0.707. So, 0 ≤ 0.707, which is true.

The triangle has an obtuse angle at C, which is given. Points P and Q are on sides AB and BC respectively, with CPQ being a right angle. AC is 25 units, CP is 20 units, and angle APC is equal to angle A plus angle B. Hmm, let me try to visualize this. Since angle C is obtuse, triangle ABC is an obtuse triangle with angle C being the largest. So, angle A and angle B must be acute. Points P and Q are on AB and BC, so PQ is a segment connecting them. Since CPQ is a right angle, angle CPQ is 90 degrees. Also, angle APC is equal to angle A plus angle B. That might be useful later.\n\nFirst, let me recall some properties of triangles. Since angle C is obtuse, the sum of angles A and B must be less than 90 degrees. Also, since angle C is obtuse, angle A and angle B are both acute. So, angle A + angle B < 90°. That's a key point.\n\nNow, let's assign coordinates to the triangle to make calculations easier. Let me place point C at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Let's let point A be at (a, 0) since angle C is obtuse, so point A is not on the x-axis. Let's let point B be at (b, c) such that the triangle is obtuse at C. Since angle C is obtuse, the dot product of vectors CA and CB should be negative. Let's compute that.\n\nVector CA is (a, 0) and vector CB is (b, c). Their dot product is a*b + 0*c = ab. Since angle C is obtuse, ab < 0. So, ab is negative.\n\nNow, let's place point P on AB. Since AB is the line from A(a, 0) to B(b, c), the equation of AB is (y - 0)/(x - a) = (c - 0)/(b - a) = c/(b - a). So, the equation of AB is y = (c/(b - a))(x - a). Therefore, point P can be parameterized as (a + t*(b - a), (c/(b - a))(a + t*(b - a))) for some t between 0 and 1.\n\nSimilarly, point Q is on BC. Since BC is the line from B(b, c) to C(0,0), the equation of BC is (y - c)/(x - b) = (0 - c)/(0 - b) = c/b. So, the equation of BC is y = (c/b)(x - b). Therefore, point Q can be parameterized as (b + s*(b - b), (c/b)(b + s*(b - b))) for some s between 0 and 1.\n\nNow, angle CPQ is 90 degrees. So, the vectors CP and CQ must be perpendicular. Let's compute vectors CP and CQ.\n\nVector CP is from C(0,0) to P(a + t*(b - a), (c/(b - a))(a + t*(b - a))).

The expression is (0.2)^3 + 1 divided by (0.2 + 1). First, I need to compute the numerator and the denominator separately. Let's start with the numerator: (0.2)^3. That's 0.2 multiplied by itself three times. Let me calculate that. 0.2 times 0.2 is 0.04, and then 0.04 times 0.2 is 0.008. So the numerator is 0.008 + 1. To add 1 to 0.008, I can think of it as 0.008 plus 1.000, which is 1.008. So the numerator is 1.008. Now, the denominator is 0.2 + 1. Adding 0.2 and 1.000 gives 1.200. So the denominator is 1.200. Now, the entire expression is 1.008 divided by 1.200. To divide these two numbers, I can convert them to fractions or perhaps use a calculator. Let me try converting them to fractions. 1.008 is 1008/1000, which simplifies to 252/250. 1.200 is 1200/1000, which simplifies to 6/5. So the expression becomes 252/250 divided by 6/5. Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So 252/250 multiplied by 5/6. Let me compute that. 252 multiplied by 5 is 1260, and 250 multiplied by 6 is 1500. So 1260 divided by 1500. To simplify this, I can divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor. The greatest common divisor of 1260 and 1500 is 60. Dividing both by 60 gives 21/25. So the answer is 21/25. Let me check if that's correct. Let me compute the original expression again to verify. 0.2^3 is 0.008, plus 1 is 1.008.

First, I need to figure out how many days have passed since Monday and how many hours are left after 20:21. Then, I can determine the day of the week based on the total number of days.\n\nStarting with the hours: 20:21 is 20 hours and 21 minutes past midnight. Since there are 24 hours in a day, 20 hours is 20/24 of a day. Let me calculate that. 20 divided by 24 is 0.8333... So, 20 hours is 0.8333... of a day. Then, 21 minutes is a fraction of an hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 21 minutes is 21/60 of an hour. Let me compute that: 21/60 = 0.35. So, 21 minutes is 0.35 of an hour. Therefore, the total time elapsed is 0.8333... + 0.35 hours.\n\nAdding these together: 0.8333... + 0.35 = 1.1833... hours. So, 1.1833... hours is approximately 1 hour and 10.833... minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 10.833... minutes is 10 minutes and 49.999... seconds. Wait, 10.833... minutes is 10 minutes and 50 seconds. So, the total time elapsed is 1 hour and 10 minutes and 50 seconds.\n\nNow, let's convert this into days and hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, 1 hour is 1/24 of a day. So, 1 hour is 0.0416... of a day. Then, 10 minutes is 10/60 of an hour, which is 0.1666... of an hour. 50 seconds is 50/3600 of an hour, which is 0.01388... of an hour. Adding these together: 0.0416... + 0.1666... + 0.01388... = 0.22128... of a day. So, 1.1833... hours is approximately 0.22128... of a day. Therefore, the total time elapsed is 1 day and 0.22128... of a day.\n\nSince the original time was 20:21 on Monday, which is 20 hours and 21 minutes past midnight, adding 1 day and 0.22128... of a day would bring us to 21:21 on Tuesday. Wait, but 21:21 is 9:21 PM, which is Friday. Let me check that again.\n\nStarting from Monday at 20:21, adding 1 day is 21:21, which is Friday. Then, adding 0.22128... of a day. Since 0.22128... of a day is approximately 12 hours and 12 minutes, which is 12 hours and 1\n\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant that provides well‑reasoned but short responses.\nYou first briefly think about the reasoning process as an internal monologue and then provide the user with the answer.\nRespond in the following format:\n\nProblem: 6.

Hmm, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, let's recall that the union of seven subsets of X has at least n elements. We need to find the minimal n where this condition forces three subsets to intersect. So, the key here is that even if we take any seven subsets, their union has enough elements to guarantee that three of them must intersect. That seems like a Ramsey-type problem, but with subsets instead of colors.\n\nI remember that in Ramsey theory, we often deal with graphs where edges represent subsets, and the Ramsey number R(k,l) is the smallest number of vertices such that any graph with that many vertices contains either a clique of size k or an independent set of size l. But here, we're dealing with subsets, so maybe we can model this as a graph where each vertex is a subset, and edges connect subsets that intersect. Then, the problem reduces to finding the minimal n such that any graph with at least n vertices containing a clique of size 3 (since three subsets intersect) must contain a clique of size 7 (since seven subsets have a union of at least n elements).\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the union of seven subsets has at least n elements. So, if we can model this as a graph where edges represent subsets intersecting, then the condition is that any graph with at least n vertices containing a clique of size 3 must contain a clique of size 7. Therefore, the minimal n is the Ramsey number R(3,7). But R(3,7) is the smallest number such that any graph with at least R(3,7) vertices containing a clique of size 3 must contain a clique of size 7. So, R(3,7) is the answer here.\n\nBut how do we compute R(3,7)? The Ramsey number R(k,l) is known for small values, but for larger k and l, it's more complicated. However, in this case, since k=3 and l=7, which are both small, we can compute R(3,7) directly.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the formula for Ramsey numbers. For example, R(3,7) is known to be 10. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, R(3,7) is the smallest number such that any graph with at least 10 vertices contains either a clique of size 3 or an independent set of size 7. So, if we have a graph with 10 vertices, then either there's a clique of size 3 or an independent set of size 7. But in our problem, we have 15 subsets, so the union of any seven of them has at least n elements. If we can find the minimal n such that any graph with at least n vertices containing a clique of size 3 must contain a clique of size 7, then that's R(3,7).\n\nAlternatively, we can use the fact that R(k,l) is the minimal number such that any graph with at least R(k,l) vertices containing a clique of size k or an independent set of size l.

The function is given as y = 1/sqrt(x² - 6x + 8) + log₂[(x + 3)/(x - 1) - 2]. To find its domain, I need to determine all real numbers x for which the expression is defined. Let's break this down into two parts: the square root and the logarithm.\n\nFirst, let's consider the square root part: 1/sqrt(x² - 6x + 8). The expression inside the square root must be positive because the square root of a negative number is not real, and the square root of zero would make the denominator zero, which is undefined. So, x² - 6x + 8 > 0.\n\nLet me solve the inequality x² - 6x + 8 > 0. To find the roots of the quadratic equation x² - 6x + 8 = 0, I can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = [6 ± sqrt(36 - 32)] / 2 = [6 ± sqrt(4)] / 2 = [6 ± 2]/2\n\nSo, the roots are x = (6 + 2)/2 = 4 and x = (6 - 2)/2 = 2. Therefore, the quadratic x² - 6x + 8 factors as (x - 2)(x - 4). The expression is positive when x is less than 2 or greater than 4. So, x² - 6x + 8 > 0 when x < 2 or x > 4.\n\nNext, let's consider the logarithm part: log₂[(x + 3)/(x - 1) - 2]. The argument of the logarithm must be positive, and the denominator of the fraction inside the logarithm must not be zero. Let's handle each part.\n\nFirst, the denominator of the fraction inside the logarithm: (x + 3)/(x - 1). The denominator cannot be zero, so x ≠ 1. Also, the numerator (x + 3) must not be zero, so x ≠ -3. So, x ≠ 1 and x ≠ -3.\n\nAdditionally, the expression inside the logarithm, (x + 3)/(x - 1) - 2, must be positive. Let's simplify this expression:\n\n(x + 3)/(x - 1) - 2 = (x + 3 - 2(x - 1))/(x - 1) = (x + 3 - 2x + 2)/(x - 1) = (-x + 5)/(x - 1) = (5 - x)/(x - 1)\n\nSo, the expression inside the logarithm is (5 - x)/(x - 1). For this to be positive, we need (5 - x)/(x - 1) > 0. Let's analyze this inequality.\n\nThe critical points are x = 5 and x = 1. These divide the real line into three intervals: (-∞, 1), (1, 5), and (5, ∞). Let's test each interval.\n\n1. For x < 1: Let's take x = 0. Then (5 - 0)/(0 - 1) = 5/(-1) = -5, which is negative. So, the expression is negative in (-∞, 1).\n\n2. For 1 < x < 5: Let's take x = 2.

The first term is x₀ = 1, which is 1 / (2^0) = 1. The second term is x₁ = 1/2, which is 1 / (2^1). The third term is x₂ = 1/3, which is 1 / (2^2). So, yes, the general term is indeed 1 / (2^{n-1}). So, the answer is f(n) = 1 / (2^{n-1}).\n\n</answer>\n<think>\nAlright, so the sequence is defined by x₀ = 1 and xₙ = xₙ₋₁ / (xₙ₋₁ + 1) for n ≥ 1. Let me verify that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with x₀ = 1. Then, x₁ = x₀ / (x₀ + 1) = 1 / (1 + 1) = 1 / 2. Correct. Then, x₂ = x₁ / (x₁ + 1) = (1/2) / (1/\n\n<answer>\n</answer>\n<think>\nWait, let me check again. The sequence is defined by x₀ = 1 and xₙ =", "e71c071_correct": false}

Let me start by understanding the sequence. The first term is 24, and each subsequent term is 100 times the previous term plus 134. Hmm, so each term is 100 times the previous term plus a remainder. That's interesting. Maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me denote a_n = 100a_{n-1} + 134. Then, to find a_n mod 99, I need to compute 100a_{n-1} + 134 mod 99. Since 100 mod 99 is 1, that simplifies to a_{n-1} + 134 mod 99. So, a_n ≡ a_{n-1} + 134 mod 99. That's a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can use the method of finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's consider the homogeneous part: a_n = a_{n-1} + 134. The characteristic equation for this is r - 1 = 0, so r = 1. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n = C * 1^n = C, where C is a constant.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (134), I can assume a particular solution of the form a_n = A. Plugging this into the recurrence relation:\n\nA = 100A + 134\n\nSolving for A:\n\n99A = -134\n\nA = -134 / 99\n\nBut 99 is 3*33, so 99 mod 99 is 0, so 134 mod 99 is 35. Therefore, A = 35. So the particular solution is a_n = 35.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C + 35. To find C, we can use the initial condition. Since a_1 = 24, we have:\n\n24 = C + 35\n\nC = 24 - 35 = -11\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = -11 + 35 = 24. But wait, that seems wrong because the recurrence relation is a_{n} = 100a_{n-1} + 134.

Let's denote the centers of the circles as $O_{1}$ and $O_{2}$, and the radii as $r_{1}$ and $r_{2}$.\n\nFirst, note that $O_{1}A$ and $O_{2}A$ are radii of $K_{1}$ and $K_{2}$ respectively, so $O_{1}A = r_{1}$ and $O_{2}A = r_{2}$. Since $A$ is a common point of both circles, $O_{1}A$ and $O_{2}A$ are both radii, so $O_{1}A = O_{2}A = r_{1} = r_{2}$. Therefore, the circles are congruent.\n\nNow, consider the line $BC$. Since $BC$ is a chord of both circles, and the third line is parallel to $BC$, we can use the properties of parallel lines and similar triangles. Let's denote the length of $BC$ as $a$. Since $BC$ is a chord of both circles, the distance from the center of each circle to $BC$ is the perpendicular distance from $O_{1}$ to $BC$ and from $O_{2}$ to $BC$. Let's denote these distances as $d_{1}$ and $d_{2}$ respectively.\n\nSince $BC$ is a chord of both circles, the perpendicular distance from the center of each circle to $BC$ is the same as the distance from the center to the chord. Therefore, $d_{1} = d_{2}$. Let's denote this common distance as $d$. Then, the length of $BC$ can be expressed in terms of $d$ and the radius $r$ of the circles. The length of a chord of a circle is given by $2\\sqrt{r^2 - d^2}$. Therefore, $a = 2\\sqrt{r^2 - d^2}$. Solving for $r^2 - d^2$, we get $r^2 - d^2 = \\frac{a^2}{4}$.\n\nNow, consider the third line, which is parallel to $BC$ and intersects the circles at points $M$ and $N$.

Three lines are drawn through point $A$: two pass through the centers of the circles and intersect them at points $B$ and $C$, the third is parallel to $BC$ and intersects the circles at points $M$ and $N$. We need to find the length of segment $MN$ given that the length of segment $BC$ is $a$.\n\nFirst, let's visualize the setup. Circles $K_{1}$ and $K_{2}$ intersect at point $A$. The two lines passing through $A$ are the radii of the circles, so $AB$ and $AC$ are radii of $K_{1}$ and $K_{2}$ respectively. The third line is parallel to $BC$ and intersects the circles at points $M$ and $N$. We need to find the length of $MN$.\n\nSince $BC$ is a chord of both circles, and the third line is parallel to $BC$, we can use properties of parallel lines and circles to find the length of $MN$.
