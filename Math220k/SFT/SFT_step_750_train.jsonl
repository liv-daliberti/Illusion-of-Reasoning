Calculate the total distance Andrea has already traveled.\n2. Determine the remaining distance to be traveled.\n3. Find out how many days remain in the trip.\n4. Calculate the average distance per day for the remaining part of the trip.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total distance Andrea has already traveled:\n\\[\n\\text{Distance traveled} = \\frac{3}{7} \\times 168 \\text{ km}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{3 \\times 168}{7} \\text{ km}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{504}{7} \\text{ km}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 72 \\text{ km}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the remaining distance to be traveled:\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining distance} = 168 \\text{ km} - 72 \\text{ km}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 96 \\text{ km}\n\\]\n\nNow, we know there are 3 more days left in the trip (since it is a six-day trip). To find the average distance per day for the remaining part of the trip, we divide the remaining distance by the number of remaining days:\n\\[\n\\text{Average distance per day} = \\frac{96 \\text{ km}}{3 \\text{ days}}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 32 \\text{ km/day}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Andrea must average \\(32\\) km per day for the remainder of her trip.

Let the speed of the pedestrian be \\(v_p\\) and the speed of the cyclist be \\(v_c\\).\n\nAfter one hour, the pedestrian is three times farther from the cyclist than from point \\(A\\). This means that at this moment, the pedestrian has traveled \\(\\frac{2}{3}d\\) (since he is three times farther from the cyclist than from point \\(A\\)), and the cyclist has traveled \\(\\frac{1}{3}d\\).\n\nThe relative speed of the pedestrian with respect to the cyclist is \\(v_p - v_c\\).

The pedestrian has been traveling for 1.5 hours, so he has traveled \\(1.5v_p\\), and the cyclist has traveled \\(0.5v_c\\). Since they meet after 45 minutes, the sum of the distances they have traveled must equal the total distance \\(d\\):\n\\[ 1.5v_p + 0.5v_c = d. \\]\n\nWe now have two equations:\n1. \\( v_p - v_c = d \\)\n2. \\( 1.5v_p + 0.5v_c = d \\)\n\nFrom the first equation, we can express \\(v_p\\) in terms of \\(v_c\\):\n\\[ v_p = d + v_c. \\]\n\nSubstitute this into the second equation:\n\\[ 1.5(d + v_c) + 0.5v_c = d. \\]\nSimplify the equation:\n\\[ 1.5d + 1.5v_c + 0.5v_c = d, \\]\n\\[ 1.5d + 2v_c = d, \\]\n\\[ 1.5d - d = -2v_c, \\]\n\\[ 0.5d = 2v_c, \\]\n\\[ v_c = 0.25d. \\]\n\nNow substitute \\(v_c = 0.25d\\) back into the expression for \\(v_p\\):\n\\[ v_p = d + 0.25d = 1.25d. \\]\n\nThe time taken by the pedestrian to travel from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) is the total distance divided by his speed:\n\\[ t = \\frac{d}{v_p} = \\frac{d}{1.25d} = \\frac{1}{1.25} = \\frac{4}{5} = 0.8 \\text{ hours}. \\]\n\nThus, the time it took the pedestrian to travel from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) is \\(\\boxed{0.8}\\) hours."}

For this to hold for all \\( z \\), the polynomial \\( P \\) must have some special properties.\n\nFirst, let's consider what happens when we substitute \\( z = 0 \\):\n\\[ P(0) = P(-c)P(c) \\]\nThis tells us that if \\( P(0) \\neq 0 \\), then \\( P(-c) \\) and \\( P(c) \\) must be reciprocals of each other. This means that \\( P(x) \\) cannot have any roots at \\( x = c \\) or \\( x = -c \\).\n\nNext, let's consider what happens when we substitute \\( z = c \\):\n\\[ P(c^2) = P(0)P(2c) \\]\nSince \\( P(0) \\neq 0 \\), we can divide both sides by \\( P(0) \\):\n\\[ P(c^2) = P(2c) \\]\n\nNow, let's consider what happens when we substitute \\( z = -c \\):\n\\[ P((-c)^2) = P(0)P(2c) \\]\nAgain, since \\( P(0) \\neq 0 \\), we can divide both sides by \\( P(0) \\):\n\\[ P(c^2) = P(2c) \\]\n\nSo, we see that \\( P(c^2) = P(2c) \\). This suggests that \\( P(x) \\) might be a constant multiple of \\( (x - c)(x + c) \\). Let's check if this form satisfies the original equation:\n\\[ P(x) = k(x - c)(x + c) \\]\nfor some constant \\( k \\).

Since \\( P \\) is not the zero polynomial, we must have \\( k = 1 \\). Therefore, the only polynomial that satisfies the given condition is \\( P(x) = (x - c)(x + c) \\).\n\nFinally, we need to compute the sum of all values of \\( P\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) \\) over all nonconstant polynomials \\( P \\) satisfying the given constraint. The value of \\( P\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) \\) for \\( P(x) = (x - c)(x + c) \\) is:\n\\[ P\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{3} - c\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{3} + c\\right) = \\frac{1}{9}(1 - c^2) \\]\nHowever, since \\( c \\) is the largest possible real number, \\( c \\) can take on any real value except 0. But the specific value of \\( c \\) does not affect the final result because the expression \\( \\frac{1}{9}(1 - c^2) \\) will always yield the same value regardless of the choice of \\( c \\).\n\nThus, the sum of all values of \\( P\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) \\) over all nonconstant polynomials \\( P \\) satisfying the given constraint is simply the value of \\( P\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) \\) itself, which is:\n\\[ \\boxed{\\frac{1}{9}} \\]"}

Let's denote this two-digit number as $x = 10a + b$. Then the expression inside the denominator can be written as:\n$$\n\\overline{a b 64}-36 \\cdot \\overline{a b}=100a + 10b + 64 - 36(10a + b)\n$$\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n$$\n100a + 10b + 64 - 360a - 36b = -260a - 26b + 64\n$$\n\nNow let's consider the numerator of the original fraction:\n$$\n64 = 8^2\n$$\n\nWe want to express $-260a - 26b + 64$ in terms of powers of 8. Notice that:\n$$\n-260a - 26b + 64 = -26(a + b) + 64\n$$\n\nSince $a$ and $b$ are digits (i.e., integers from 0 to 9), their sum $a + b$ will range from 0 to 18. Therefore, $-26(a + b)$ will range from -180 to 180. Adding 64 to these values gives us a new range for our expression:\n$$\n-116 \\leq -26(a + b) + 64 \\leq 244\n$$\n\nThis means that the simplified form of the fraction must have a denominator that divides both 64 and the difference between the two expressions above. The only common divisor of 64 and any integer within the given range is 1 or 8. Since we are looking for an irreducible fraction, the denominator should not share any other factors with 64 besides 1 or 8.\n\nThus, the simplified form of the fraction is:\n$$\n\\frac{64}{\\overline{a b 64}-36 \\cdot \\overline{a b}} = \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n\nTherefore, the irreducible form of the fraction is $\\frac{1}{8}$.\n\nFor part b), we need to prove that the number $n=3^{23}+5^{23}+15^{23}$ is divisible by 23. We can use modular arithmetic to show this. First, note that:\n$$\n3^{23} \\equiv (-2)^{23} \\equiv -2^{23} \\pmod{23}\n$$\n$$\n5^{23} \\equiv (-1)^{23} \\equiv -1 \\pmod{23}\n$$\n$$\n15^{23} \\equiv 2^{23} \\pmod{23}\n$$\n\nSo,\n$$\nn = 3^{23} + 5^{23} + 15^{23} \\equiv -2^{23} - 1 + 2^{23} \\equiv -1 \\pmod{23}\n$$\n\nHowever, there seems to be a mistake in the previous step. Instead, we should directly check if $n$ is divisible by 23 using Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that for any integer $a$ and prime $p$, $a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$ when $p$ does not divide $a$. Here, $p = 23$ and $a = 3, 5, 15$. Thus:\n$$\n3^{22} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{23}, \\quad 5^{22} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{23}, \\quad 15^{22} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{23}\n$$\n\nMultiplying these congruences together:\n$$\n(3^{22})(5^{22})(15^{22}) \\equiv 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{23}\n$$\n\nAdding back the initial term:\n$$\nn = 3^{23} + 5^{23} + 15^{23} \\equiv 3^{22}(3)(5^{22})(5)(15^{22})(15) \\equiv 1 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 15 \\equiv 225 \\equiv"}

Determine the angle of inclination of the cone's generatrix to the base plane.\nassistant\n[Think] Let's denote the radius of the larger base by $R$ and the radius of the smaller base by $r$. Since the height of the truncated cone is equal to the radius of its larger base, we have $h = R$. The perimeter of a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle of radius $R$ is $6R$, so the perimeter of the smaller base is also $6R$. Similarly, the perimeter of an equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle of radius $R$ is $\\sqrt{3} \\cdot 2R = 2\\sqrt{3}R$, so the perimeter of the larger base is also $2\\sqrt{3}R$.\n\nThe slant height (generatrix) of the truncated cone can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the height, the difference between the radii of the bases, and the slant height:\n\\[ l^2 = h^2 + (R - r)^2 = R^2 + (R - r)^2. \\]\n\nThe angle of inclination $\\theta$ of the generatrix to the base plane can be determined from the tangent function:\n\\[ \\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{adjacent}} = \\frac{R}{R - r}. \\]\n\nWe need to find $\\theta$ such that this equation holds. However, without specific numerical values for $R$ and $r$, it is not possible to determine the exact value of $\\theta$. Therefore, the problem does not provide enough information to solve for $\\theta$ numerically or symbolically. \n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)}\n\\]\n\nThis represents the general form of the solution, but it cannot be simplified further without additional constraints on $R$ and $r$."}

Therefore, the probability that both make their shots in one round is $\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)=\\frac{1}{2}$. So, the probability that they will be an excellent pair in the first round is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.\n\n(2) Let $n$ be the number of rounds needed for 16 excellent pairs. Then, the expected number of excellent pairs after $n$ rounds is $np_{1}^{n} + np_{2}^{n} \\geqslant 16$. Given $p_{1} + p_{2} = \\frac{4}{3}$, we have $p_{1}^{n} + p_{2}^{n} \\geqslant \\frac{16}{\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^{n}}$. To minimize $n$, we set $p_{1} = p_{2} = \\frac{2}{3}$, which gives us $n \\geqslant 5$. This means that at least 5 rounds are needed for 16 excellent pairs. Now, let's find the values of $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$ when $n=5$. We have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& p_{1}^{5} + p_{2}^{5} \\geqslant \\frac{16}{\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^{5}} \\\\\n& \\Rightarrow p_{1}^{5} + p_{2}^{5} \\geqslant \\frac{16}{\\frac{1024}{243}} \\\\\n& \\Rightarrow p_{1}^{5} + p_{2}^{5} \\geqslant \\frac{16 \\times 243}{1024} \\\\\n& \\Rightarrow p_{1}^{5} + p_{2}^{5} \\geqslant \\frac{972}{1024} \\\\\n& \\Rightarrow p_{1}^{5} + p_{2}^{5} \\geqslant \\frac{243}{256}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSince $p_{1} = p_{2} = \\frac{2}{3}$ satisfies the inequality, the values of $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$ at this time are $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$."}
