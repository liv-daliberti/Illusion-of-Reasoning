Let's start with part (a).\n\n### Part (a)\n\nWe need to find all positive integers \\( n \\) such that \\( a_{kn} = a_n \\) for all integers \\( 1 \\leq k \\leq n \\). This means that applying the function \\( a \\) repeatedly must eventually return to its original value after some finite number of steps.\n\nLet's analyze the given recurrence relations:\n- \\( a_1 = 1 \\)\n- \\( a_{2n} = a_n \\)\n- \\( a_{2n+1} = a_n + 1 \\)\n\nFirstly, observe that if we apply the rule \\( a_{2n} = a_n \\), it implies that every even-indexed term will be equal to the corresponding odd-indexed term. Similarly, since \\( a_{2n+1} = a_n + 1 \\), each odd-indexed term is one more than its preceding even-indexed term.\n\nNow let's consider what happens when we apply these rules multiple times:\n\n- If \\( n = 1 \\):\n  - \\( a_1 = 1 \\)\n  - Applying \\( a_{2 \\cdot 1} = a_1 \\) gives us \\( a_2 = 1 \\).\n  - Since \\( a_3 = a_1 + 1 = 2 \\), but \\( a_4 = a_2 + 1 = 2 \\), we see that \\( a_3 \\neq a_2 \\).\n\nThus, \\( n = 1 \\) does not satisfy the condition because \\( a_3 \\neq a_2 \\).\n\nNext, let's try \\( n = 2 \\):\n\n- \\( a_1 = 1 \\)\n- \\( a_2 = a_1 = 1 \\)\n- \\( a_3 = a_2 + 1 = 2 \\)\n- \\( a_4 = a_2 + 1 = 2 \\)\n\nHere, \\( a_3 = a_2 \\), so \\( n = 2 \\) satisfies the condition.\n\nFor any other \\( n > 2 \\), we can use induction or direct calculation to show that \\( a_{kn} \\neq a_n \\) for \\( k > 1 \\). For example, if \\( n = 3 \\):\n\n- \\( a_1 = 1 \\)\n- \\( a_2 = 1 \\)\n- \\( a_3 = 2 \\)\n- \\( a_6 = a_3 + 1 = 3 \\)\n- \\( a_9 = a_6 + 1 = 4 \\)\n\nClearly, \\( a_6 \\neq a_3 \\) and \\( a_9 \\neq a_3 \\).\n\nTherefore, the only positive integer \\( n \\) that satisfies the condition is \\( n = 2 \\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only positive integer \\( n \\) such that \\( a_{kn} = a_n \\) for all integers \\( 1 \\leq k \\leq n \\) is \\( n = 2 \\).\n\n### Part (b)\n\nTo prove that there exist infinitely many positive integers \\( m \\) such that \\( a_{km} \\geq a_m \\) for all positive integers \\( k \\), we need to understand how the sequence grows relative to itself.\n\nFrom our analysis above, we know that:\n- \\( a_{2n} = a_n \\)\n- \\( a_{2n+1} = a_n + 1 \\)\n\nThis suggests that the growth rate of \\( a_n \\) increases by 1 at each step from even to odd indices. Therefore, for any fixed \\( m \\), the terms \\( a_{km} \\) will grow faster than \\( a_m \\) as \\( k \\) increases.\n\nSince the sequence grows incrementally by 1 at each step from even to odd indices, there will always be values of \\( k \\) such that \\( km \\) exceeds \\( m \\), ensuring that \\( a_{km} \\geq a_m \\).\n\nHence, there indeed exist infinitely many positive integers \\( m \\) satisfying \\( a_{km} \\geq a_m \\) for all positive integers \\( k \\).\n\nIn conclusion, the proof relies on understanding the incremental increase in the sequence's growth rate from even to odd indices, leading to the existence of infinitely many \\( m \\) where \\( a_{km} \\geq a_m \\).", "100_correct": false, "100_changed": false}

The point moves in straight lines inside the triangle and bounces elastically off an edge at an angle equal to the angle of incidence. Suppose that the point starts at the origin and begins motion in the direction of $(1,1)$. After the ball has traveled a cumulative distance of $30\\sqrt{2}$, compute its distance from the origin.\nassistant\nThink about this problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding Bounce Mechanics**: When the point hits an edge of the triangle, it reflects according to the law of reflection (angle of incidence equals angle of reflection). This means we can treat each bounce as if the triangle were replaced by a larger one where the original triangle's edges become part of the new triangle.\n\n2. **Scaling Factor for Bounces**: Each time the point hits an edge, it effectively travels twice the length of the side of the triangle it was on. For example, hitting the bottom edge once would be equivalent to traveling 2 units vertically; hitting the right edge once would be equivalent to traveling $\\sqrt{3} \\times 2$ horizontally.\n\n3. **Cumulative Distance Calculation**:\n   - The initial movement is along the line $(1,1)$.\n   - To find out how many times the point will hit the sides of the triangle before reaching a cumulative distance of $30\\sqrt{2}$, we need to calculate the number of segments the path consists of. Since each segment represents a bounce, we divide the total distance by the sum of the lengths of the sides of the triangle.\n\n4. **Sum of Triangle Sides**: The perimeter of the unit equilateral triangle is $3$, so the sum of the lengths of its sides is $3$.\n\n5. **Number of Bounces**: Dividing the total distance by the perimeter gives us the number of bounces:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of bounces} = \\frac{30\\sqrt{2}}{3} = 10\\sqrt{2}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Distance Traveled per Bounce**: Each bounce corresponds to traveling twice the length of the side of the triangle. Therefore, after $n$ bounces, the point travels:\n   \\[\n   2n \\times \\text{side length}\n   \\]\n   Here, $n = 10\\sqrt{2}$, so the total distance traveled is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 10\\sqrt{2} \\times \\text{side length}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Side Length of the Triangle**: The side length of the triangle is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n\n8. **Total Distance Traveled**: Substituting the values, we get:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 10\\sqrt{2} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 10\\sqrt{6}\n   \\]\n\n9. **Final Distance from Origin**: The final distance from the origin is simply the total distance traveled because the point ends up exactly at the opposite vertex of the triangle due to the nature of bouncing within the triangle.\n\nTherefore, the distance from the origin when the point has traveled a cumulative distance of $30\\sqrt{2}$ is $10\\sqrt{6}$.", "100_correct": false, "100_changed": false}

If Anya gives half of her mushrooms to Vitya, all the children will have the same number of mushrooms, and if instead Anya gives all her mushrooms to Sasha, Sasha will have as many mushrooms as all the others combined. How many children went to pick mushrooms\nassistant\nLet's denote the total number of children by \\( n \\) and the number of mushrooms Anya has by \\( A \\). Let the number of mushrooms each child initially has be denoted by \\( x_i \\) for \\( i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n \\).\n\nFirst, consider the scenario where Anya gives half of her mushrooms to Vitya. After this exchange, each of the \\( n-1 \\) other children will have \\( x_i + \\frac{A}{2} \\) mushrooms, and Anya will have \\( \\frac{A}{2} \\) mushrooms. Since they end up having the same number of mushrooms, we can write:\n\\[\nx_1 + \\frac{A}{2} = x_2 + \\frac{A}{2} = \\cdots = x_n + \\frac{A}{2}\n\\]\nThis implies that the initial number of mushrooms each child had is equal to the number of mushrooms Anya gave away plus half of her original amount. Therefore, we have:\n\\[\nx_i = \\frac{A}{2} \\quad \\text{for all } i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the scenario where Anya gives all her mushrooms to Sasha. In this case, Sasha will have \\( A \\) mushrooms, and the remaining \\( n-1 \\) children will have \\( x_i - A \\) mushrooms. According to the problem statement, Sasha will have as many mushrooms as all the others combined, so we can write:\n\\[\nA = (n-1)(x_i - A)\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( x_i = \\frac{A}{2} \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[\nA = (n-1)\\left(\\frac{A}{2} - A\\right) = (n-1)\\left(-\\frac{A}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{(n-1)A}{2}\n\\]\nSince \\( A \\neq 0 \\), we can divide both sides by \\( A \\):\n\\[\n1 = -\\frac{n-1}{2}\n\\]\nSolving for \\( n \\), we find:\n\\[\nn-1 = -2 \\implies n = -1\n\\]\nHowever, since \\( n \\) must be a positive integer, there seems to be an error in our interpretation or assumptions. Revisiting the problem, let's assume the correct interpretation should lead us to a consistent solution.\n\nGiven the conditions, let's re-evaluate the problem constraints more carefully. If Anya gives half of her mushrooms to Vitya, the condition implies that the initial distribution of mushrooms among the children was such that giving half to Vitya would result in an equal distribution. This suggests a specific pattern in the initial distribution that satisfies these conditions.\n\nBy trial and error or logical deduction, we can find that if there were 4 children, and Anya had 8 mushrooms, then after giving half to Vitya, each child would have 4 mushrooms, satisfying the condition. Similarly, if Anya gives all her mushrooms to Sasha, Sasha would have 8 mushrooms, which is exactly what the other children combined have, satisfying the second condition.\n\nThus, the number of children who went to pick mushrooms is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]", "100_correct": false, "100_changed": false}

Since the numbers range from 1 to 10, we know that the maximum sum is 19 (if someone draws 10 and 9) and the minimum sum is 3 (if someone draws 1 and 2).\n\nNow, let's analyze the sums provided:\n\n1. For A[11], the only way to get a sum of 11 using two different numbers between 1 and 10 is if one number is 5 and the other is 6.\n   - Therefore, A could be {5, 6} or {6, 5}.\n   \n2. For B[4], the only way to get a sum of 4 using two different numbers between 1 and 10 is if one number is 1 and the other is 3.\n   - Therefore, B could be {1, 3} or {3, 1}.\n   \n3.

For E[17], the only way to get a sum of 17 using two different numbers between 1 and 10 is if one number is 8 and the other is 9.\n   - Therefore, E could be {8, 9} or {9, 8}.\n\nGiven these possibilities, we can now match the sums to the correct pairs:\n\n- If A were {5, 6}, then B must be {1, 3} because their sum is 4.\n- If B were {1, 3}, then A must be {5, 6} because their sum is 11.\n- If C were {2, 5}, then D must be {1, 5} because their sum is 6.\n- If D were {1, 5}, then C must be {2, 5} because their sum is 7.\n- If E were {8, 9}, then E must be {8, 9} because their sum is 17.\n\nThus, the correct pairings are:\n- A = {5, 6}\n- B = {1, 3}\n- C = {2, 5}\n- D = {1, 5}\n- E = {8, 9}\n\nTherefore, the numbers each person drew are:\n- Person A drew 5 and 6.\n- Person B drew 1 and 3.\n- Person C drew 2 and 5.\n- Person D drew 1 and 5.\n- Person E drew 8 and 9.", "100_correct": false, "100_changed": false}

A perpendicular line is drawn from a point within the segment $A A_{1}$ intersecting the ellipse at points $C$ and $D$. Connect $A C$ and $A_{1} D$ intersecting at $P$. Find the equation of the curve on which point $P$ lies.\nassistant\n[Think] Let's denote the coordinates of point $P$ as $(x, y)$. Since $A P \\perp A_{1} C$, we have:\n$$\\angle A P C=\\angle A_{1} C P=90^{\\circ}$$\n\nTherefore,\n$$\\tan \\angle A P C=\\frac{|A P|}{|A C|}, \\quad \\tan \\angle A_{1} C P=\\frac{|A_{1} P|}{|A_{1} C|}$$\n\nSince $A P=A_{1} P$, it follows that:\n$$\\tan \\angle A P C=\\tan \\angle A_{1} C P$$\n\nThus, the angle between lines $A P$ and $A_{1} C$ is equal to the angle between lines $A_{1} P$ and $A_{1} C$. Therefore, quadrilateral $A P A_{1} C$ is cyclic.\n\nBy the definition of a circle, there exists a unique circle passing through three non-collinear points $A, A_{1}, P$. This circle must pass through point $O(0, 0)$ because $A O=A_{1} O=OA_{1}=a$. Thus, the equation of this circle is:\n$$x^{2}+y^{2}=a^{2}$$\n\nHence, the equation of the curve on which point $P$ lies is:\n$$\\boxed{x^{2}+y^{2}=a^{2}}$$", "100_correct": false, "100_changed": false}

Let's denote this sum by \\( S(n) \\):\n\n\\[\nS(n) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\phi(k).\n\\]\n\nThus, we have:\n\n\\[\nS(n) = \\frac{3 n^2 + 5}{8}.\n\\]\n\nFirst, let's consider small values of \\( n \\) to see if we can identify any patterns or specific solutions.\n\nFor \\( n = 1 \\):\n\n\\[\nS(1) = \\phi(1) = 1,\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\frac{3 \\cdot 1^2 + 5}{8} = \\frac{8}{8} = 1.\n\\]\nSo, \\( n = 1 \\) satisfies the equation.\n\nNext, for \\( n = 2 \\):\n\n\\[\nS(2) = \\phi(1) + \\phi(2) = 1 + 1 = 2,\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\frac{3 \\cdot 2^2 + 5}{8} = \\frac{17}{8} \\neq 2.\n\\]\nSo, \\( n = 2 \\) does not satisfy the equation.\n\nNow, let's try \\( n = 3 \\):\n\n\\[\nS(3) = \\phi(1) + \\phi(2) + \\phi(3) = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4,\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\frac{3 \\cdot 3^2 + 5}{8} = \\frac{34}{8} = 4.25 \\neq 4.\n\\]\nSo, \\( n = 3 \\) does not satisfy the equation.\n\nFor \\( n = 4 \\):\n\n\\[\nS(4) = \\phi(1) + \\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(4) = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6,\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\frac{3 \\cdot 4^2 + 5}{8} = \\frac{53}{8} \\neq 6.\n\\]\nSo, \\( n = 4 \\) does not satisfy the equation.\n\nFor \\( n = 5 \\):\n\n\\[\nS(5) = \\phi(1) + \\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(4) + \\phi(5) = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 10,\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\frac{3 \\cdot 5^2 + 5}{8} = \\frac{80}{8} = 10.\n\\]\nSo, \\( n = 5 \\) satisfies the equation.\n\nFor \\( n = 6 \\):\n\n\\[\nS(6) = \\phi(1) + \\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(4) + \\phi(5) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 2 = 12,\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\frac{3 \\cdot 6^2 + 5}{8} = \\frac{113}{8} \\neq 12.\n\\]\nSo, \\( n = 6 \\) does not satisfy the equation.\n\nFrom these calculations, it appears that only \\( n = 1 \\) and \\( n = 5 \\) seem to work. To confirm there are no other solutions, we would need to prove that for \\( n > 5 \\), the left-hand side (the sum of the totients) cannot be exactly half of the right-hand side (which is \\(\\frac{3 n^2 + 5}{8}\\)).\n\nHowever, without further advanced techniques like modular arithmetic or deeper properties of the totient function, we can conclude based on our initial checks that the only solutions are \\( n = 1 \\) and \\( n = 5 \\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1 \\text{ and } 5}\n\\]", "100_correct": false, "100_changed": true}

How many teams participated in the competition? And what is the total score of all the teams?\nassistant\nLet's denote the number of teams participating in the competition by $n$. The scores for each team can be represented as follows:\n\n- Team 1: 11 points\n- Team 2: 9 points\n- Team 3: 7 points\n- Team 4: 5 points\n\nThe sum of these scores must equal the total points distributed among all teams, which we will call $S$.\n\nSince there are no ties, every match results in either one win and one loss or two draws. Each match contributes 2 points to the total score ($2 \\times 1 = 2$) because it involves two teams. Therefore, if there were $m$ matches played, the total score would be $2m$, where $m$ is the number of matches.\n\nWe know that the highest possible score for any team is 11 points, so the maximum value for $m$ is $\\frac{11}{2} = 5.5$. Since $m$ must be an integer, the maximum number of matches that could have been played is 5. This means that at most 5 matches could have resulted in wins and losses, leaving room for up to 5 more matches resulting in draws.\n\nNow let's consider the distribution of points. If we assume that the top three teams won all their matches against the bottom four teams, this would account for 6 matches (since there are 4 teams below the top three), giving them a combined total of $3 \\times 11 + 4 \\times 0 = 33$ points. However, since they only got 11 points in total, some of these matches must have ended in draws.\n\nIf we subtract the points from the top three teams' total from the overall total, we get:\n$$ S - 33 = 2m $$\n\nGiven that $m$ cannot exceed 5, let's test the possibilities:\n\n- If $m=5$, then $S - 33 = 10$, meaning $S = 43$.\n- If $m=4$, then $S - 33 = 8$, meaning $S = 41$.\n- If $m=3$, then $S - 33 = 6$, meaning $S = 45$.\n- If $m=2$, then $S - 33 = 4$, meaning $S = 47$.\n- If $m=1$, then $S - 33 = 2$, meaning $S = 49$.\n\nHowever, none of these values satisfy the condition that the fifth-place team has a different score than the fourth-place team. Therefore, the correct scenario must involve fewer matches being played, reducing the number of matches to 4.\n\nWith $m=4$, we have:\n$$ S - 33 = 8 $$\n$$ S = 41 $$\n\nThis leaves us with the equation:\n$$ 41 = 2 \\times 4 + 4 \\times 0 $$\n$$ 41 = 8 $$\n\nThus, the total score of all teams is 41 points. Now, let's determine how many teams participated in the competition. We know that the top three teams had a total of 33 points, while the bottom four teams had a total of 11 points. Subtracting the lower total from the higher gives us:\n$$ 33 - 11 = 22 $$\n\nThese 22 points represent the difference between the top three teams' total and the bottom four teams' total. Since each match results in 2 points, and we've accounted for 4 matches (as calculated above), the remaining matches must have resulted in draws. Thus, the number of matches involving the bottom four teams is 4, confirming our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the total number of teams participating in the competition was 5, and the total score of all teams was 41 points.", "100_correct": false, "100_changed": false}

Suppose $f$ is a constant function, i.e., $f(n) = c$ for some constant $c$. Then substituting into the given functional equation, we get:\n\n\\[\nf(x + f(y)) = f(x) + y \\implies c = c + y \\implies y = 0.\n\\]\n\nSince this must hold for all $x$ and $y$, it implies that $y$ can only be zero, which contradicts the requirement that $f$ maps to $\\mathbf{N}^*$ (the set of positive integers). Therefore, no constant function satisfies the equation.\n\n### Step 2: Check injectivity.\nNext, we need to show that $f$ is injective. Assume $f(a) = f(b)$ for some $a, b \\in \\mathbf{N}^*$. We want to show that $a = b$. From the functional equation,\n\n\\[\nf(x + f(b)) = f(x) + b \\quad \\text{and} \\quad f(x + f(a)) = f(x) + a.\n\\]\n\nIf $f(a) = f(b)$, then\n\n\\[\nf(x + f(b)) = f(x + f(a)).\n\\]\n\nThis implies\n\n\\[\nf(x) + b = f(x) + a \\implies b = a.\n\\]\n\nThus, $f$ is injective.\n\n### Step 3: Find the form of $f$.\nNow, assume $f(1) = k$ for some $k \\in \\mathbf{N}^*$. Using the injectivity of $f$, we know that $f(k) = 1$. Next, consider $f(f(1)) = f(k) = 1$. This means\n\n\\[\nf(f(1)) = f(k) = 1.\n\\]\n\nBy injectivity, $f(1) = 1$. Now, using the original functional equation with $x = 1$ and $y = 1$, we get\n\n\\[\nf(1 + f(1)) = f(1) + 1 \\implies f(2) = 2.\n\\]\n\nWe can generalize this argument. For any $n \\in \\mathbf{N}^*$, since $f$ is injective, we have\n\n\\[\nf(f(n-1)) = n-1 \\implies f(n) = n.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, $f(n) = n$ for all $n \\in \\mathbf{N}^*$. Let's verify that this function indeed satisfies the original functional equation. If $f(n) = n$, then\n\n\\[\nf(x + f(y)) = f(x + y) = x + y = f(x) + y,\n\\]\n\nwhich confirms that our proposed solution works. Thus, the only function $f: \\mathbf{N}^{*} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{N}^{*}$ that satisfies the given functional equation is\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{f(n) = n}.\n\\]", "100_correct": true, "100_changed": false}

This can happen in two scenarios:\n1. The last chip drawn is red.\n2. Both green chips are drawn.\n\nFor scenario 1 (the last chip is red), we need to choose which of the 3 red chips will be the last one drawn. There are $\\binom{3}{1} = 3$ ways to do this. Then, we have 2 red chips left and 2 green chips remaining, so there are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways to arrange these 4 chips such that no green chip comes after a red chip. Therefore, there are $3 \\times 6 = 18$ ways for the last chip to be red.\n\nFor scenario 2 (both green chips are drawn), we need to choose which 2 out of the 3 red chips will be drawn first. There are $\\binom{3}{2} = 3$ ways to do this. After drawing the first 2 red chips, we have 1 red chip left and 2 green chips remaining, so there are $\\binom{3}{1} = 3$ ways to arrange these 3 chips such that neither green chip comes after a red chip. Therefore, there are $3 \\times 3 = 9$ ways for both green chips to be drawn.\n\nAdding these together, there are $18 + 9 = 27$ ways for either scenario to occur.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of possible outcomes when drawing all 5 chips. We have 5 positions to fill with 3 red chips and 2 green chips, so there are $\\binom{5}{3} = 10$ ways to arrange them.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the 3 reds are drawn is $\\frac{27}{10}$. However, since probabilities cannot exceed 1, we must divide by 2 to get the correct probability:\n\n$$\\frac{\\frac{27}{10}}{2} = \\frac{27}{20}$$\n\nThis fraction does not match any of the given options directly. Let's re-evaluate our approach:\n\nThe correct way to look at it is to consider the sequence of events where the 3 reds are drawn. For each red chip drawn, there are fewer choices available because the next chip could be either red or green. Specifically:\n\n- If the first red chip is drawn, there are 2 red chips left and 2 green chips, giving us $\\binom{2}{2} = 1$ way to arrange the remaining chips.\n- If the second red chip is drawn, there is only 1 red chip left and 2 green chips, giving us $\\binom{1}{1} = 1$ way to arrange the remaining chips.\n- If the third red chip is drawn, there are no more red chips left, so there is only 1 way to arrange the remaining chips.\n\nThus, the total number of favorable sequences is $1 + 1 + 1 = 3$, and the total number of possible sequences is $\\binom{5}{3} = 10$. Therefore, the probability is $\\frac{3}{10}$.\n\nSo, the correct answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}}$.", "100_correct": false, "100_changed": false}

Let S be the set of 2 x 2 matrices over F with trace 1 and determinant 0. Find |S|. Solution\nassistant\nThink about it this way:\n\nThe problem asks us to find the number of 2x2 matrices over a finite field F_p (where p is prime) that have a trace of 1 and determinant of 0.\n\nLet's denote these matrices by A = [a b; c d]. The conditions we need are:\n1. Trace(A) = a + d = 1\n2. Determinant(A) = ad - bc = 0\n\nWe can express the second condition as ad = bc, which means that the columns of A must form a basis for F^2 over F_p.\n\nNow, let's count the number of such matrices. We know there are p choices for each entry in the matrix, so initially, we might think there are p^4 possible matrices. However, not all of these will satisfy our conditions.\n\nTo simplify, consider the structure of the matrix. Since the determinant is zero, one column must be a scalar multiple of the other. This gives us two cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: One column is a scalar multiple of the other.\nIn this case, we can choose the non-zero column in p ways, and the remaining entries are uniquely determined up to multiplication by a constant in F_p. So, there are p^3 matrices in this case.\n\nCase 2: Both columns are linearly independent.\nIn this case, we can choose any pair of distinct columns from the four available ones. There are C(4,2) = 6 ways to do this. For each choice, the remaining two entries are uniquely determined up to multiplication by constants in F_p. So, there are 6p^2 matrices in this case.\n\nAdding these together, we get a total of p^3 + 6p^2 matrices satisfying both conditions.

To solve it, we can try to factorize or use numerical methods. However, for simplicity, let's check if there are obvious rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are $\\pm 1$, but neither satisfies the equation since substituting $x=1$ results in $-1 = 0$ which is false, and similarly for $x=-1$.\n\nSince no simple rational root exists, we need another approach.

This implies that the only solution is when $x = y = z$. \n\nNow, let's verify if there are other solutions. Suppose $x, y, z$ are not necessarily equal.

A cube is inscribed in a regular quadrilateral pyramid; the vertices of its upper base lie on the lateral edges, and the vertices of its lower base are in the plane of the pyramid's base. Find the ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the pyramid, if the lateral edge of the pyramid makes an angle $\\alpha$ with the base plane.\nassistant\n[Think] Let's denote the side length of the cube by $a$, the height of the pyramid by $h$, and the distance from the center of the base of the pyramid to one of its sides by $d$. The relationship between these variables can be derived using trigonometry.\n\nThe height of the pyramid forms a right triangle with half the diagonal of the base (which is also the radius of the circumscribed circle of the base) and the slant height of the pyramid. This gives us:\n\n$$ h = d \\cdot \\tan(\\alpha) $$\n\nSince the cube is inscribed in the pyramid, we have:\n\n$$ a = d \\cdot \\cos(\\alpha) $$\n\nNow let's find the volume of the pyramid and the cube. The volume of the pyramid is given by:\n\n$$ V_{\\text{pyramid}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot S_{\\text{base}} \\cdot h $$\n\nwhere $S_{\\text{base}}$ is the area of the base of the pyramid. Since the base is a square, we have:\n\n$$ S_{\\text{base}} = 2d^2 $$\n\nThus,\n\n$$ V_{\\text{pyramid}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 2d^2 \\cdot d \\cdot \\tan(\\alpha) = \\frac{2}{3} d^3 \\tan(\\alpha) $$\n\nFor the cube, the volume is simply:\n\n$$ V_{\\text{cube}} = a^3 = (d \\cdot \\cos(\\alpha))^3 = d^3 \\cdot \\cos^3(\\alpha) $$\n\nTo find the ratio of the volumes, we divide the volume of the pyramid by the volume of the cube:\n\n$$ \\frac{V_{\\text{pyramid}}}{V_{\\text{cube}}} = \\frac{\\frac{2}{3} d^3 \\tan(\\alpha)}{d^3 \\cos^3(\\alpha)} = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{\\sin(\\alpha)}{\\cos^3(\\alpha)} = \\frac{2 \\sin(\\alpha)}{3 \\cos^3(\\alpha)} $$\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the pyramid is:\n\n$$ \\boxed{\\frac{2 \\sin(\\alpha)}{3 \\cos^3(\\alpha)}} $$", "100_correct": false, "100_changed": false}

Each root of $P(x^2)$ corresponds to two roots of $P(x)$ because if $r$ is a root of $P(x^2)$, then $x = r^{1/2}$ or $x = -r^{1/2}$ will be a root of $P(x)$.

The derivative of a polynomial is another polynomial, and its degree is one less than the degree of the original polynomial. If $P(x)$ has $k$ roots, including multiplicities, then its derivative will have $k-1$ roots.

Therefore, this proposition is false.\n\n(2) **If a number field \\( F \\) has a non-zero element, then \\( 2016 \\in F \\)**: This statement is also false.

This notation suggests that $\\overline{a b 64}$ is a three-digit number where $a$ and $b$ are digits, and the number has a leading zero for clarity. Therefore, $\\overline{a b 64}$ can be written as $100a + 10b + 64$. \n\nThe denominator of our fraction is:\n$$\n\\overline{a b 64} - 36 \\cdot \\overline{a b}\n$$\n\nSubstituting $\\overline{a b 64}$ with $100a + 10b + 64$ and simplifying, we get:\n$$\n(100a + 10b + 64) - 36(10a + b) = 100a + 10b + 64 - 360a - 36b = -260a - 26b + 64\n$$\n\nNow, let's look at the numerator, which is simply 64. The fraction becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{64}{-260a - 26b + 64}\n$$\n\nSince both the numerator and the denominator have common factors, we can factor out these common terms. However, since the exact values of $a$ and $b$ are not specified, we cannot determine if there are any common factors other than 1. Thus, the fraction remains in its simplified form without further reduction unless specific values for $a$ and $b$ are provided.\n\n### Part (b)\nTo prove that the number $n = 3^{23} + 5^{23} + 15^{23}$ is divisible by 23, we will use modular arithmetic, specifically modulo 23.\n\nFirst, note that:\n$$\n3^{\\phi(23)} \\equiv 1 (\\text{mod } 23), \\quad 5^{\\phi(23)} \\equiv 1 (\\text{mod } 23), \\quad 15^{\\phi(23)} \\equiv 1 (\\text{mod } 23)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\phi(n)$ denotes Euler's totient function, which counts the positive integers up to a given integer n that are relatively prime to n. Since 23 is a prime number, $\\phi(23) = 22$. Therefore:\n$$\n3^{22} \\equiv 1 (\\text{mod } 23), \\quad 5^{22} \\equiv 1 (\\text{mod } 23), \\quad 15^{22} \\equiv 1 (\\text{mod } 23)\n$$\n\nGiven that $23$ divides $22$, we can write:\n$$\n3^{23} = 3 \\cdot 3^{22} \\equiv 3 \\cdot 1 (\\text{mod } 23), \\\\\n5^{23} = 5 \\cdot 5^{22} \\equiv 5 \\cdot 1 (\\text{mod } 23), \\\\\n15^{23} = 15 \\cdot 15^{22} \\equiv 15 \\cdot 1 (\\text{mod } 23)\n$$\n\nAdding these congruences together, we get:\n$$\nn = 3^{23} + 5^{23} + 15^{23} \\equiv 3 + 5 + 15 (\\text{mod } 23)\n$$\n\nSimplifying the right-hand side:\n$$\n3 + 5 + 15 = 23\n$$\n\nThus:\n$$\nn \\equiv 23 (\\text{mod } 23)\n$$\n\nThis shows that $n$ leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by 23, meaning $n$ is indeed divisible by 23.", "100_correct": false, "100_changed": true}

Since the height of the truncated cone is equal to the radius of its larger base, we have:\n$$ h = R $$\n\nThe perimeter of a regular hexagon inscribed in the larger base is six times the length of one side, so it equals:\n$$ 6 \\cdot 2R = 12R $$\n\nSimilarly, the perimeter of an equilateral triangle inscribed in the smaller base is three times the length of one side, which equals:\n$$ 3 \\cdot 2r = 6r $$\n\nSince these perimeters are equal, we can set them equal to each other:\n$$ 12R = 6r $$\n\nSolving for $r$, we get:\n$$ r = 2R $$\n\nNow let's consider the right triangle formed by the height of the truncated cone ($h$), the difference between the radii of the bases ($R - r$), and the slant height of the cone ($l$). We know that:\n$$ l^2 = h^2 + (R - r)^2 $$\n\nSubstituting the values of $h$ and $r$, we get:\n$$ l^2 = R^2 + (R - 2R)^2 = R^2 + (-R)^2 = 2R^2 $$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we find:\n$$ l = R\\sqrt{2} $$\n\nThe angle $\\alpha$ of inclination of the cone's generatrix to the base plane is given by:\n$$ \\tan{\\alpha} = \\frac{l}{R} = \\frac{R\\sqrt{2}}{R} = \\sqrt{2} $$\n\nTherefore, the angle of inclination of the cone's generatrix to the base plane is:\n$$ \\alpha = \\arctan(\\sqrt{2}) $$\n\nThis completes our solution.", "100_correct": false, "100_changed": false}

Find the minimum number of angles under the given conditions.\nassistant\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of angles around a point. When angles are measured in degrees and their sum is 360°, they can be represented as multiples of 5°. This means each angle must be a multiple of 5°.\n\nLet's denote the angles as \\(5^\\circ \\times k_1\\), \\(5^\\circ \\times k_2\\), ..., \\(5^\\circ \\times k_n\\) where \\(k_i\\) are integers. Since these angles form a complete circle around point O, their sum must equal 360°:\n\\[5^\\circ \\times k_1 + 5^\\circ \\times k_2 + \\cdots + 5^\\circ \\times k_n = 360^\\circ.\\]\n\nWe can factor out the common term 5° from the left side:\n\\[5^\\circ (k_1 + k_2 + \\cdots + k_n) = 360^\\circ.\\]\n\nDividing both sides by 5° gives us:\n\\[k_1 + k_2 + \\cdots + k_n = 72.\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest possible value for the sum of these integers \\(k_i\\). To minimize the sum, we should use the largest possible values for the \\(k_i\\)'s while keeping them positive integers. \n\nThe largest integer less than or equal to 72/5 is 14 because:\n\\[72 / 5 = 14.4,\\]\nso the largest integer is 14. If all \\(k_i\\) were 14, the sum would be:\n\\[14 \\times 14 = 196.\\]\n\nHowever, since we have more than one set of angles, let's consider using smaller values for some of the \\(k_i\\)'s. We can try setting two of the \\(k_i\\)'s to 13 and the rest to 12:\n\\[13 + 13 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 = 13 \\times 2 + 12 \\times 8 = 26 + 96 = 122.\\]\n\nThis sum is still not optimal. Let's try another combination:\n\nIf three of the \\(k_i\\)'s are 13, four are 12, and the remaining two are 11:\n\\[13 \\times 3 + 12 \\times 4 + 11 \\times 2 = 39 + 48 + 22 = 109.\\]\n\nThis sum is also not optimal. Let's try another approach:\n\nIf five of the \\(k_i\\)'s are 12, six are 11, and the remaining one is 10:\n\\[12 \\times 5 + 11 \\times 6 + 10 \\times 1 = 60 + 66 + 10 = 136.\\]\n\nThis sum is still not optimal. Finally, let's try the combination of seven 12's and one 10:\n\\[12 \\times 7 + 10 \\times 1 = 84 + 10 = 94.\\]\n\nThis sum is still not optimal. After trying several combinations, it becomes clear that the smallest sum greater than 72 is obtained when we use eight 12's:\n\\[12 \\times 8 = 96.\\]\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of angles required to measure 360° around point O, if each angle is a power of 5, is 8.", "100_correct": false, "100_changed": false}

We can calculate the probability of them not being an \"excellent pair\" by considering all possible outcomes where either Jia or Yi misses both shots.\n\n- The probability that Jia misses both shots is $(1-p_1)^2$.\n- The probability that Yi misses both shots is $(1-p_2)^2$.\n- Therefore, the probability that neither makes a shot is $(1-p_1)^2 \\cdot (1-p_2)^2$.\n\nThe probability that they are an \"excellent pair\" is the complement of the above probability:\n$$ P(\\text{Excellent Pair}) = 1 - (1-p_1)^2 \\cdot (1-p_2)^2 $$\n\nSubstituting the given values $p_1 = \\frac{3}{4}$ and $p_2 = \\frac{2}{3}$ into the formula:\n\n$$ P(\\text{Excellent Pair}) = 1 - \\left(1-\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 \\cdot \\left(1-\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 $$\n$$ P(\\text{Excellent Pair}) = 1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 $$\n$$ P(\\text{Excellent Pair}) = 1 - \\frac{1}{16} \\cdot \\frac{1}{9} $$\n$$ P(\\text{Excellent Pair}) = 1 - \\frac{1}{144} $$\n$$ P(\\text{Excellent Pair}) = \\frac{143}{144} $$\n\nSo, the probability that Jia and Yi will be an \"excellent pair\" in the first round of the game is $\\boxed{\\frac{143}{144}}$.", "100_correct": false, "100_changed": false}

To find the position of the 2003rd term, we need to solve the equation:\n\n$$\n\\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - k = 2003\n$$\n\nwhere $k$ represents the number of deletions up to the $(n-1)$th term.\n\nSolving this equation gives us:\n\n$$\nn^2 + n - 4006 = 0\n$$\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\n$$\nn = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n$$\n\nwe substitute $a=1$, $b=1$, and $c=-4006$:\n\n$$\nn = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 4 \\times 4006}}{2}\n$$\n\n$$\nn = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{16025}}{2}\n$$\n\nSince $n$ must be a positive integer, we take the positive root:\n\n$$\nn = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{16025}}{2}\n$$\n\nCalculating the value inside the square root:\n\n$$\n\\sqrt{16025} = 126.5\n$$\n\nSubstituting back into the equation:\n\n$$\nn = \\frac{-1 + 126.5}{2}\n$$\n\n$$\nn = \\frac{125.5}{2}\n$$\n\n$$\nn = 62.75\n$$\n\nSince $n$ must be an integer, we round down to the nearest whole number:\n\n$$\nn = 62\n$$\n\nThis means that after deleting the first 62 terms, we would have reached the 2003rd term if no deletions had occurred. However, since some deletions have already taken place, we need to adjust our calculation accordingly.\n\nGiven that the 2003rd term has been deleted multiple times due to previous deletions, we need to subtract these deletions from the total count. Let's denote the number of deletions before reaching the 2003rd term as $d$.\n\nThen:\n\n$$\nd = \\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}\n$$\n\nSubstituting $n=62$:\n\n$$\nd = \\frac{(62-1)(62-2)}{2}\n$$\n\n$$\nd = \\frac{61 \\times 60}{2}\n$$\n\n$$\nd = 1830\n$$\n\nNow, we subtract the number of deletions from the original count:\n\n$$\n2003 - d = 2003 - 1830 = 173\n$$\n\nTherefore, the 2003rd term of the sequence is the 173rd non-deleted term.\n\nHowever, upon re-evaluating the problem statement, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or error in the provided options.

This implies that each partial sum of the sequence has a remainder when divided by $k$, and these remainders must follow a specific pattern.\n\nGiven that $a_1 = 2021^{2021}$, we can start by examining the initial terms:\n\n- For $k=1$: The expression simplifies to $a_1$, so $a_1$ must be divisible by 1.\n- For $k=2$: We have $a_1 - a_2$, which must be divisible by 2. Since $a_1 = 2021^{2021}$ is odd (as it's a power of an odd number), $a_2$ must be even.\n- For $k=3$: We have $a_1 - a_2 + a_3$, which must be divisible by 3. Given that $a_1$ is odd and $a_2$ is even, $a_3$ must be odd to satisfy divisibility by 3.\n\nThis pattern suggests that the sequence alternates between odd and even values based on their position in the sequence. Specifically:\n- Odd positions yield odd numbers,\n- Even positions yield even numbers.\n\nSince there are 2021 terms in total, half will be odd and half will be even. Therefore, the 2021st term ($a_{2021}$) should be even because 2021 is an odd number.\n\nTo determine the exact value of $a_{2021}$, we need to consider how the sequence progresses from its initial value. However, without more information or additional constraints, we cannot definitively calculate the exact value of $a_{2021}$. \n\nThus, while we know that $a_{2021}$ is even, we do not have enough information to find its precise numerical value.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is that the 2021st term of the sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ is even but cannot be determined precisely from the given data alone.\n\n[/think]\n\n<answer>\nThe 2021st term of the sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ is even but cannot be determined precisely from the given data alone.

Find the range of $x$.\nassistant\nTo solve the inequality \\(x^2 - (a + 1)x - a^2 > 0\\) for all \\(a \\in (1, 2)\\), we need to analyze how the expression changes with respect to \\(a\\). The key is to find the minimum value of the quadratic function \\(f(a) = x^2 - (a + 1)x - a^2\\) over the interval \\(a \\in (1, 2)\\).\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the inequality:\n\\[ f(a) = x^2 - (a + 1)x - a^2 > 0. \\]\n\nWe can complete the square for the quadratic expression:\n\\[ x^2 - (a + 1)x - a^2 = \\left(x - \\frac{a+1}{2}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{a+1}{2}\\right)^2 - a^2. \\]\nSimplifying further,\n\\[ x^2 - (a + 1)x - a^2 = \\left(x - \\frac{a+1}{2}\\right)^2 - \\frac{(a+1)^2}{4} - a^2. \\]\nCombining like terms,\n\\[ x^2 - (a + 1)x - a^2 = \\left(x - \\frac{a+1}{2}\\right)^2 - \\frac{(a+1)^2 + 4a^2}{4}. \\]\nThis simplifies to\n\\[ x^2 - (a + 1)x - a^2 = \\left(x - \\frac{a+1}{2}\\right)^2 - \\frac{5a^2 + 2a + 1}{4}. \\]\nFor the inequality to hold for all \\(a \\in (1, 2)\\), the term inside the parentheses must be positive because it is always non-negative. Therefore, we need\n\\[ \\left(x - \\frac{a+1}{2}\\right)^2 > \\frac{5a^2 + 2a + 1}{4}. \\]\nThe right-hand side is minimized when \\(a = 1\\):\n\\[ \\frac{5(1)^2 + 2(1) + 1}{4} = \\frac{8}{4} = 2. \\]\nSo, we need\n\\[ \\left(x - \\frac{a+1}{2}\\right)^2 > 2. \\]\nTaking the square root on both sides, we get\n\\[ |x - \\frac{a+1}{2}| > \\sqrt{2}. \\]\nThis gives us two inequalities:\n\\[ x - \\frac{a+1}{2} > \\sqrt{2} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x - \\frac{a+1}{2} < -\\sqrt{2}, \\]\nwhich simplify to\n\\[ x > \\frac{a+1}{2} + \\sqrt{2} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x < \\frac{a+1}{2} - \\sqrt{2}. \\]\nSince this must hold for all \\(a \\in (1, 2)\\), we take the union of these intervals:\n\\[ x > \\max\\left(\\frac{1+1}{2} + \\sqrt{2}, \\frac{3}{2} - \\sqrt{2}\\right) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x < \\min\\left(\\frac{3}{2} + \\sqrt{2}, \\frac{3}{2} - \\sqrt{2}\\right). \\]\nCalculating the values, we have\n\\[ x > \\frac{2}{2} + \\sqrt{2} = 1 + \\sqrt{2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x < \\frac{3}{2} - \\sqrt{2}. \\]\nTherefore, the range of \\(x\\) is\n\\[ \\boxed{\\left(-\\infty, \\frac{3}{2} - \\sqrt{2}\\right) \\cup \\left(1 + \\sqrt{2}, \\infty\\right)}. \\]", "100_correct": false, "100_changed": false}

Let's start by writing down the equations based on the information provided:\n\n1. The total sum of their ages:\n\\[ t + m + x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) = 88 \\]\n\n2. The relationship between the mother's age and the sum of her children's ages minus 10:\n\\[ x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) = m - 10 \\]\n\n3. The relationship between the father's age and the mother's age:\n\\[ t = m + x \\]\n\nNow let's substitute these expressions into each other to find the values of \\(x\\), \\(m\\), and \\(t\\).\n\nFirst, simplify the equation for the total sum of their ages:\n\\[ t + m + x + x + 2 + x + 4 = 88 \\]\n\\[ t + m + 3x + 6 = 88 \\]\n\\[ t + m + 3x = 82 \\] (Equation 1)\n\nNext, use Equation 2 to express \\(m\\) in terms of \\(x\\):\n\\[ x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) = m - 10 \\]\n\\[ 3x + 6 = m - 10 \\]\n\\[ m = 3x + 16 \\] (Equation 2)\n\nSubstitute \\(m\\) from Equation 2 into Equation 1:\n\\[ t + (3x + 16) + 3x = 82 \\]\n\\[ t + 6x + 16 = 82 \\]\n\\[ t = 66 - 6x \\] (Equation 3)\n\nFinally, use Equation 3 to find \\(t\\) in terms of \\(x\\). Now we have three equations:\n1. \\( t + m + 3x = 82 \\)\n2. \\( m = 3x + 16 \\)\n3. \\( t = 66 - 6x \\)\n\nWe can now substitute \\(m\\) and \\(t\\) back into one of the original equations to solve for \\(x\\):\n\nUsing Equation 1:\n\\[ (66 - 6x) + (3x + 16) + 3x = 82 \\]\n\\[ 66 - 6x + 3x + 16 + 3x = 82 \\]\n\\[ 66 + 16 = 82 \\]\n\\[ 82 = 82 \\]\n\nThis confirms our substitutions are correct. Now, let's solve for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[ 66 - 6x + 3x + 16 + 3x = 82 \\]\n\\[ 66 + 16 = 82 \\]\n\\[ 82 = 82 \\]\n\nSimplifying further:\n\\[ 82 = 82 \\]\n\nSo, solving for \\(x\\):\n\\[ 66 - 6x + 3x + 16 + 3x = 82 \\]\n\\[ 66 + 16 = 82 \\]\n\\[ 82 = 82 \\]\n\nThus, we get:\n\\[ 66 - 6x + 3x + 16 + 3x = 82 \\]\n\\[ 66 + 16 = 82 \\]\n\\[ 82 = 82 \\]\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\\[ x = 5 \\]\n\nNow, substituting \\(x = 5\\) back into the equations:\n\\[ m = 3(5) + 16 = 25 \\]\n\\[ t = 66 - 6(5) = 36 \\]\n\nSo, the ages are:\n- Youngest daughter: 5 years old\n- Mother: 25 years old\n- Father: 36 years old\n\nThese calculations confirm the initial conditions stated in the problem. Therefore, the final answer is:\nThe daughters are 5, 7, and 9 years old; the mother is 31 years old; and the father is 36 years old.", "100_correct": false, "100_changed": true}

Since $ABC$ is equilateral, this means that $BX = CX = BC$. Similarly, since $ABC$ is equilateral, we also have $BY = CY = BC$. Thus, quadrilaterals $BXCY$ and $BAYC$ are cyclic.\n\nSince $R$ is the orthocenter of $\\triangle ABP$, it follows that $BR$ is perpendicular to $AP$.

Also, $\\angle BTR = 180^{\\circ} - \\angle BRT = 180^{\\circ} - \\angle BRC = 180^{\\circ} - 60^{\\circ} = 120^{\\circ}$. Finally, $\\angle BTS = 180^{\\circ} - \\angle BST = 180^{\\circ} - \\angle BSC = 180^{\\circ} - 60^{\\circ} = 120^{\\circ}$. Therefore, $\\angle BTR = \\angle BTS = \\angle BTS = 120^{\\circ}$. This implies that $\\triangle BTR$ is equilateral, which means that $BT = TR = RT$. But $BT = CT$, so $CT = TR = RT$. Therefore, $CT = RS$. Since $CT = CS$, it follows that $CS = RS$. Therefore, $CR = CS = RS$. Since $CR$ is a radius of circle $BRS$, it follows that $CR = RS$. Therefore, $CR = RS = ST$. Since $CR = RS$, it follows that $CR = RS = ST = SR$.

Therefore, if \\( P_1(3, a) \\) is symmetric to \\( P_2(b, -2) \\) with respect to the x-axis, it must be true that:\n\\[ b = 3 \\]\nand\n\\[ a = 2 \\]\n\nSo, the value of \\( a \\) is 2, and the value of \\( b \\) is 3.\n\n### Step 2: Coordinates of the Point Symmetric to the y-axis\n\nThe point symmetric to \\( P_1(3, 2) \\) with respect to the y-axis will have its x-coordinate changed to its opposite (i.e., negative), while the y-coordinate remains the same. Thus, the coordinates of the point symmetric to \\( P_1 \\) with respect to the y-axis are:\n\\[ (-3, 2) \\]\n\n### Step 3: Coordinates of the Point Symmetric to the Origin\n\nSimilarly, the point symmetric to \\( P_1(3, 2) \\) with respect to the origin will have both its x-coordinate and y-coordinate changed to their opposites. Therefore, the coordinates of the point symmetric to \\( P_1 \\) with respect to the origin are:\n\\[ (-3, -2) \\]\n\nIn summary:\n- The values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are 2 and 3, respectively.\n- The coordinates of the point symmetric to \\( P_1 \\) with respect to the y-axis are \\( (-3, 2) \\).\n- The coordinates of the point symmetric to \\( P_1 \\) with respect to the origin are \\( (-3, -2) \\).", "100_correct": true, "100_changed": false}

We can do this by expressing \\(\\cos \\theta\\) and \\(\\sin \\theta\\) in terms of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\\[ \\cos \\theta = 4 - x \\]\n\nFrom the second equation:\n\\[ \\sin \\theta = 1 - y \\]\n\nSince \\(\\cos^2 \\theta + \\sin^2 \\theta = 1\\), we substitute the expressions for \\(\\cos \\theta\\) and \\(\\sin \\theta\\):\n\\[ (4 - x)^2 + (1 - y)^2 = 1 \\]\n\nExpanding and simplifying this equation:\n\\[ 16 - 8x + x^2 + 1 - 2y + y^2 = 1 \\]\n\\[ x^2 + y^2 - 8x - 2y + 15 = 0 \\]\n\nRearranging terms, we get:\n\\[ x^2 - 8x + y^2 - 2y + 15 = 0 \\]\n\nCompleting the square for both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\):\n\\[ (x^2 - 8x + 16) + (y^2 - 2y + 1) = 16 + 1 - 15 \\]\n\\[ (x - 4)^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 2 \\]\n\nThis is the equation of a circle with center \\((4, 1)\\) and radius \\(\\sqrt{2}\\). However, since the original problem states that \\(0 \\leqslant \\theta \\leqslant \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), we need to check if the entire circle is within this range or only part of it.\n\nWhen \\(\\theta = 0\\), \\(x = 4 - \\cos(0) = 4 - 1 = 3\\) and \\(y = 1 - \\sin(0) = 1 - 0 = 1\\). So, the point \\((3, 1)\\) lies on the circle.\n\nWhen \\(\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), \\(x = 4 - \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = 4 - 0 = 4\\) and \\(y = 1 - \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = 1 - 1 = 0\\). So, the point \\((4, 0)\\) also lies on the circle.\n\nTherefore, the parametric equations represent the upper half of a circle centered at \\((4, 1)\\) with radius \\(\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Part of a circle}}\n\\]", "100_correct": true, "100_changed": false}

This triangle has one angle of $120^\\circ$ and two sides forming another angle of $120^\\circ$ between them.

The sum of the digits of $44n$ is 800.\n\nWe need to find the sum of the digits of $3n$.\n\nFirst, let's consider what happens when we multiply a number by 44. If we add another digit (which doesn't affect the sum of the digits), it will be multiplied by 4 or 5 times more than if we just added one digit. This means that multiplying by 44 increases the sum of the digits by at least 96 (since adding a single digit can increase the sum by up to 9).\n\nGiven that the sum of the digits of $44n$ is 800, this implies that the sum of the digits of $n$ must have been significantly larger initially. Specifically, since adding a single digit would only increase the sum by 9, and there were 96 extra digits added from multiplying by 44, the initial sum of the digits of $n$ had to be at least 100 + 96 = 196.\n\nNow, let's look at the multiplication by 3. When we multiply a number by 3, each digit is increased by 3, except for those whose last digit was 9, which becomes 0. Therefore, the sum of the digits of $3n$ will be three times the sum of the digits of $n$, plus any carry-over effects from the addition of these multiples of 3.\n\nSince the sum of the digits of $n$ is 100, the sum of the digits of $3n$ will be $3 \\times 100 + 3k$, where $k$ is the total number of carries over from the multiplication by 3. Given that the sum of the digits of $44n$ is 800, and knowing that multiplying by 44 adds significant digits, we can infer that the sum of the digits of $n$ must have been very large indeed.\n\nHowever, without specific values for the individual digits of $n$, we cannot determine exact values for the sum of the digits of $3n$. But we do know that the sum of the digits of $3n$ will be much larger than 100 but less than 300, given the constraints on the sum of the digits of $n$ and the effect of multiplying by 3.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the digits of $3n$ must be between 100 and 300, inclusive. Since we don't have enough information to pinpoint the exact value, we can conclude that the sum of the digits of $3n$ is likely somewhere within this range, but we cannot determine its precise value based solely on the given information.", "100_correct": false, "100_changed": false}

There are 4 such planes for each vertex (one for each pair of opposite edges).\n\n2. **Symmetry through the midpoints of three edges meeting at a vertex**: This plane also divides the tetrahedron into two congruent parts. There are 6 such planes because there are 4 vertices, and each vertex has 3 pairs of opposite edges.\n\nAdding these together, we get:\n- 4 planes from the first type\n- 6 planes from the second type\n\nThus, the total number of planes of symmetry a regular tetrahedron can have is \\(4 + 6 = 10\\). However, if considering all possible orientations of the tetrahedron, including those where it is not regular but still symmetric, the count increases to 15 due to additional symmetries like rotations around axes passing through the centers of opposite faces or through the midpoints of opposite edges. But within the context of a standard tetrahedron, the maximum number of planes of symmetry remains 10.", "100_correct": false, "100_changed": false}

Each domino covers exactly 2 cells, so if we have a unique partition, each domino must cover either all cells or no cells at all. This means that the number of dominoes used must be equal to half the total number of cells plus possibly one extra cell covered by a single domino.\n\nThe key insight here is that for any marking of the board, there will always be some way to pair up the cells into pairs of opposite colors (assuming the board is colored in a checkerboard pattern), and thus some dominoes will necessarily cover both cells of each pair. Therefore, the minimum number of cells that need to be marked to ensure a unique partition is when they form a \"domino-free\" region that cannot be paired up without leaving out a cell.\n\nConsider a \\( 2n \\times 2n \\) board where we mark the top-left corner cell.
