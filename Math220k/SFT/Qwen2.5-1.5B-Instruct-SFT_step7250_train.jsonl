The classic problem of finding the largest monetary amount that cannot be obtained using any combination of coins of specified denominations. In this case, the denominations are 7 and 5.\n\nFirst, I remember that for two coin denominations, the Frobenius number formula is to multiply the two numbers together and subtract their product divided by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the two numbers. So, the formula would be n = 7*5 - gcd(7,5). Let me check that. 7*5 is 35, and gcd(7,5) is 1 because they're coprime. So, 35 - 1 = 34. But wait, the answer choices go up to 82, so maybe this isn't the case here?\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing things up. The Frobenius number for two numbers is indeed the largest non-representable number, but sometimes there are exceptions or other methods when one of the numbers is a prime. Since 7 and 5 are both composite numbers, maybe the standard formula applies. Let me confirm.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to use the fact that any integer can be expressed as a linear combination of two numbers if the numbers are coprime. Since 7 and 5 are coprime (their gcd is 1), then yes, every integer greater than or equal to the sum of the two numbers minus their gcd should be representable. Wait, no, actually, the formula is that all sufficiently large integers can be expressed as ax + by, given that gcd(a,b) divides some integer. Here, since gcd(7,5)=1, which divides 3, so all integers greater than or equal to 3 can be expressed as 7a +5b. Therefore, the largest integer that can't be expressed is 3 -1=2? But that doesn't make sense because 2 can't be written as 7a +5b with a, b >1. Wait, but 2 is smaller than 3, so maybe my initial thought was wrong.\n\nWait, hold on. If we have to take a and b greater than 1, then the smallest possible value for 7a +5b would be when a and b are at least 2. Let's compute that. For a=2, b=2: 7*2 +5*2=14+10=24. So 24 is the minimal value. Then, according to the Frobenius formula, the largest non-representable number is 34, but since 24 is already achievable, the largest number that can't be expressed is 24 -1=23? But 23 can't be written as 7a +5b with a,b>1. For example, let's see: 7a +5b=23. Let's try different combinations. Let's solve for a and b. Let's set up equations:\n\n7a +5b =23\n\nWe can rearrange this as 5b =23 -7a.

If a=2: 5b=23-14=9. Then 9 is not divisible by 5, so no solution. If a=1: 5b=23-7=16. 16 is not divisible by 5. So no solutions. Therefore, 23 cannot be expressed. Similarly, 24 can be expressed as 7*2 +5*2=24. So 23 is the largest number that can't be expressed. But according to the Frobenius formula, it's supposed to be 34. So there's a discrepancy here. Maybe the formula only gives the upper bound when considering all possible combinations, but in reality, there might be gaps even beyond that.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is only accurate for certain cases. Let me check another example. Suppose we have two numbers that are not coprime, like 3 and 5. Then the Frobenius number would be 3*5 - gcd(3,5)=15-1=14. But 14 can't be expressed as 3a"}

We need to find the angles of the triangle.\n\nFirst, let's recall some basic properties of triangles and altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side. The length of the altitude can be related to the area of the triangle. Specifically, the area \\( S \\) of a triangle can be expressed as \\( S = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} \\). Here, the height (altitude) corresponds to the base.\n\nGiven that two altitudes are not smaller than the sides to which they are dropped. Let's denote the triangle as \\( ABC \\), with sides \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\), opposite to angles \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\) respectively. The corresponding altitudes would be \\( h_a \\), \\( h_b \\), and \\( h_c \\).\n\nThe condition given is that two of these altitudes are not smaller than their respective bases. That is:\n- \\( h_a \\geq a \\)\n- \\( h_b \\geq b \\)\n\nWe need to relate this condition to the angles of the triangle. To do this, we can express the altitudes in terms of the area and the sides.\n\nFor example, the altitude \\( h_a \\) corresponding to side \\( a \\) can be written as:\n\\[\nh_a = \\frac{2S}{a}\n\\]\nSimilarly,\n\\[\nh_b = \\frac{2S}{b}\n\\]\n\\[\nh_c = \\frac{2S}{c}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting these into the given conditions:\n1. \\( \\frac{2S}{a} \\geq a \\)\n2. \\( \\frac{2S}{b} \\geq b \\)\n\nLet's analyze each inequality.\n\nStarting with the first inequality:\n\\[\n\\frac{2S}{a} \\geq a \\implies 2S \\geq a^2 \\implies S \\geq \\frac{a^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, the second inequality:\n\\[\n\\frac{2S}{b} \\geq b \\implies 2S \\geq b^2 \\implies S \\geq \\frac{b^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nSo, both altitudes must be at least half the square of their respective sides. Now, since the area \\( S \\) of a triangle can also be expressed using another formula involving all three sides:\n\\[\nS = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}\n\\]\nwhere \\( s = \\frac{a + b + c}{2} \\) is the semi-perimeter.\n\nBut perhaps it's more useful to consider the relationship between the sides and the altitudes.

Similarly, \\( h_b = \\frac{2S}{b} \\), and \\( h_c = \\frac{2S}{c} \\).\n\nThe condition given is that two altitudes are not smaller than their corresponding sides.
