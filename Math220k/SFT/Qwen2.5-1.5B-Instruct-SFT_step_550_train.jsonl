This is because every integer is either even or odd, and we can express both even and odd numbers as sums or differences of multiples of $2$ and $1$ (which are multiples of $7$ and $5$ respectively).\n\nNow, let's consider the possible remainders when dividing by $35$. Since $35 = 7 \\times 5$, any integer can be reduced modulo $35$. We need to find the largest remainder that cannot be expressed as a linear combination of $7$ and $5$.\n\nThe key insight is that any multiple of $7$ or $5$ will have a remainder of $0$ when divided by $35$. Therefore, we only need to check the remainders of $1, 2, 3, ..., 34$.\n\nWe can use the Chicken McNugget Theorem for this purpose. It states that for two coprime positive integers $m$ and $n$, the largest number that cannot be expressed as a non-negative integer combination of $m$ and $n$ is $mn - m - n$. Here, $m = 7$ and $n = 5$, so:\n\n\\[ mn - m - n = 7 \\cdot 5 - 7 - 5 = 35 - 7 - 5 = 23 \\]\n\nHowever, since $23$ is not one of our potential remainders, we need to check further. By checking the remainders directly, we find that the largest number less than $35$ that cannot be expressed as a linear combination of $7$ and $5$ is indeed $23$.\n\nTherefore, the largest number that cannot be written in the form $n = 7a + 5b$ is $\\boxed{23}$.", "550_correct": false, "550_changed": false}

This triangle is similar to the original trapezoid because it shares the same angles and the ratio of corresponding sides is equal to the cosine of half the included angle.\n\nIn this triangle, the side opposite the \\(60^\\circ\\) angle is \\(c\\), and the other two sides are \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).

Instead, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the sides of the trapezoid can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangles formed by the diagonals and the height of the trapezoid.\n\nThe height \\(h\\) of the trapezoid can be found using the area formula involving the diagonals and the sine of the angle between them:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} cd \\sin(60^\\circ) \\]\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 8 \\cdot h \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Area} = 2h \\sqrt{3} \\]\n\nThe area can also be expressed as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} (a + b) h \\]\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} (3 + 5) h \\]\n\\[ \\text{Area} = 4h \\]\n\nEquating the two expressions for the area:\n\n\\[ 4h = 2h \\sqrt{3} \\]\n\\[ h = \\sqrt{3} \\]\n\nNow, we can find the perimeter of the trapezoid:\n\n\\[ P = a + b + 2d \\]\n\\[ P = 3 + 5 + 2 \\cdot 8 \\]\n\\[ P = 3 + 5 + 16 \\]\n\\[ P = 24 \\]\n\nThus, the perimeter of the trapezoid is \\(24 \\text{ cm}\\).", "550_correct": false, "550_changed": false}

For $n=7$, find the total of all these alternating sums.\nassistant\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider all possible non-empty subsets of the set $\\{1,2,3, \\ldots, 7\\}$ and calculate their alternating sums. The alternating sum of a subset is defined by arranging the elements of the subset in decreasing order and then adding or subtracting them according to whether they appear before or after the largest element.\n\nFirst, let's determine the number of subsets for which the largest element is fixed at any position. If the largest element is $k$ (where $k$ ranges from 1 to 7), there are $(7-k)$ ways to choose the remaining elements. Therefore, the total number of subsets where the largest element is $k$ is $(7-k)$. Since there are 7 elements in the set, the total number of subsets is:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{7}(7-k)=6+5+4+3+2+1+0=21\n$$\n\nNext, we need to calculate the alternating sum for each of these subsets. We will use the fact that the alternating sum of a subset can be expressed in terms of the binomial coefficients. Specifically, if we have a subset $\\{a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_m\\}$ arranged in decreasing order, the alternating sum is given by:\n\n$$\n(-1)^m + (-1)^{m-1}a_1 + (-1)^{m-2}a_2 + \\cdots + (-1)^{1}a_m\n$$\n\nThis expression can be simplified using the binomial theorem. Consider the polynomial $P(x) = (x-a_1)(x-a_2)\\cdots(x-a_m)$. When expanded, it has the form:\n\n$$\nP(x) = x^m - (a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_m)x^{m-1} + \\text{(other terms)}\n$$\n\nThe alternating sum of the roots of $P(x)$ is equal to the coefficient of $x^{m-1}$ divided by $(-1)^{m-1}$. In our case, the coefficient of $x^{m-1}$ is $-(a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_m)$, so the alternating sum is:\n\n$$\n-(a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_m)\n$$\n\nNow, we need to sum up the alternating sums over all subsets. Each element appears in exactly half of the subsets (since each element can either be included or not in a subset). Therefore, the total contribution of each element to the sum of all alternating sums is zero because the positive and negative contributions cancel out. This means that the total sum of all alternating sums is zero.\n\nThus, the total of all these alternating sums is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "550_correct": false, "550_changed": false}

Therefore, after traveling $30\\sqrt{2}$, the point will have hit the boundary twice (once on each side), resulting in a total distance traveled of $45\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nNow, let's calculate the coordinates of the point after these movements. Initially, the point is at $(0,0)$. After hitting the top side, it moves down by $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\cdot 2 = \\sqrt{3}$, so it ends up at $(0,-\\sqrt{3})$. Then, it moves left by $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\cdot 2 = \\sqrt{3}$, ending up at $(-\\sqrt{3}, -\\sqrt{3})$. Finally, it moves down again by $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\cdot 2 = \\sqrt{3}$, ending up at $(-\\sqrt{3}, -2\\sqrt{3})$.\n\nAfter these three bounces, the point is at $(-\\sqrt{3}, -2\\sqrt{3})$, which is a distance of $\\sqrt{(\\sqrt{3})^2 + (-2\\sqrt{3})^2} = \\sqrt{3 + 12} = \\sqrt{15}$ from the origin. However, since the point started at $(0,0)$ and ended at $(-\\sqrt{3}, -2\\sqrt{3})$, the final distance from the origin is actually the distance between these two points:\n\n$$\n\\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(-\\sqrt{3} - 0)^2 + (-2\\sqrt{3} - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{3 + 12} = \\sqrt{15}\n$$\n\nTherefore, the distance from the origin after the point has traveled a cumulative distance of $30\\sqrt{2}$ is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{15}}$.", "550_correct": false, "550_changed": false}

Inside an equilateral triangle with side $a$, there are three equal circles, each of which touches two sides of the triangle and two other circles. Find the area of the part of the triangle that is outside these circles.\nassistant\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the area of the part of the equilateral triangle that is not covered by the three equal circles.\n\nFirst, let's determine the radius of one of the circles. Since the circles touch two sides of the triangle and two other circles, they form a smaller equilateral triangle inside the original one. The distance from the center of the circle to any side of the triangle (the apothem) can be calculated using the properties of the equilateral triangle.\n\nThe height \\( h \\) of an equilateral triangle with side length \\( a \\) is given by:\n\\[\nh = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} a\n\\]\nThe radius \\( r \\) of the inscribed circle in an equilateral triangle is half of its height:\n\\[\nr = \\frac{h}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} a\n\\]\n\nNow, consider the smaller equilateral triangle formed by the centers of the three circles. Its side length is twice the radius of the circles because it spans from the midpoint of one side of the larger triangle to the opposite side, passing through the centers of the circles. Therefore, the side length of the smaller triangle is:\n\\[\ns = 2r = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} a\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the area of the smaller equilateral triangle. The area \\( A_{\\text{small}} \\) of an equilateral triangle with side length \\( s \\) is:\n\\[\nA_{\\text{small}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} a \\right)^2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\cdot \\frac{3}{4} a^2 = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{16} a^2\n\\]\n\nThe area of the larger equilateral triangle is:\n\\[\nA_{\\text{large}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} a^2\n\\]\n\nThe area of the part of the triangle that is outside the circles is the difference between the area of the larger triangle and the areas of the three smaller triangles:\n\\[\nA_{\\text{outside}} = A_{\\text{large}} - 3 \\cdot A_{\\text{small}}\n\\]\nSubstituting the values we found:\n\\[\nA_{\\text{outside}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} a^2 - 3 \\cdot \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{16} a^2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} a^2 - \\frac{9\\sqrt{3}}{16} a^2 = \\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{16} a^2 - \\frac{9\\sqrt{3}}{16} a^2 = \\frac{-5\\sqrt{3}}{16} a^2\n\\]\n\nThus, the area of the part of the triangle that is outside the circles is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{16} a^2}\n\\]", "550_correct": false, "550_changed": false}

We know two things from the problem statement:\n\n1. If Anya gives half of her mushrooms to Vitya, all the children will have the same number of mushrooms.\n2. If Anya gives all her mushrooms to Sasha, Sasha will have as many mushrooms as all the others combined.\n\nFrom the first condition, we can write:\n\\[ m_1 + \\frac{m_2}{2} = m_3 + \\frac{m_4}{2} = \\cdots = m_n + \\frac{m_{n+1}}{2} \\]\nThis implies that the sum of the mushrooms each child has is equal when divided into halves. Therefore, the average number of mushrooms per child is the same before and after Anya's action.\n\nFrom the second condition, we can write:\n\\[ m_1 + m_2 + \\cdots + m_n = m_s + (m_1 + m_2 + \\cdots + m_{s-1}) \\]\nwhere \\( s \\) is the position of Sasha among the children.

Then the real number $a=$ $\\qquad$\nassistant\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand that if the roots of the polynomial $x^3 + 3x^2 - x + a = 0$ form an arithmetic sequence, let's denote these roots by $r-d$, $r$, and $r+d$. According to Vieta's formulas, for a cubic equation of the form $x^3 + px^2 + qx + r = 0$, the sum of the roots is equal to $-p$, the sum of the product of the roots taken two at a time is equal to $q$, and the product of the roots is equal to $-r$. Applying these to our given equation:\n\n1. The sum of the roots is:\n\\[ (r-d) + r + (r+d) = 3r \\]\nAccording to Vieta's formula, this should be equal to $-3$ (the coefficient of $x^2$), so:\n\\[ 3r = -3 \\Rightarrow r = -1 \\]\n\n2. The sum of the product of the roots taken two at a time is:\n\\[ (-1-d)r + (-1)d(r) + (-1)(r+d)r = q \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ -r^2 - dr - dr - r^2 - rd = q \\Rightarrow -2r^2 - 2dr = q \\]\nSubstituting $r = -1$ into the equation gives us:\n\\[ -2(-1)^2 - 2d(-1) = q \\Rightarrow -2 + 2d = q \\Rightarrow q = 2(1-d) \\]\n\n3. The product of the roots is:\n\\[ (-1-d)r(r+d) = -r^3 \\]\nSubstituting $r = -1$ into the equation gives us:\n\\[ (-1-d)(-1)(-1+d) = -(-1)^3 \\Rightarrow -(1+d)(1-d) = 1 \\Rightarrow -1 - d^2 = 1 \\Rightarrow d^2 = -2 \\]\nSince $d^2 = -2$ does not have real solutions, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the problem statement. However, based on the information provided and assuming the problem is correctly stated, the value of $a$ can be found using the fact that the product of the roots is $-a$.\n\nGiven that the roots are $-1-d$, $-1$, and $-1+d$, their product is:\n\\[ (-1-d)(-1)(-1+d) = -a \\Rightarrow -(-1-d)(-1+d) = -a \\Rightarrow -(-1 - d + d + d^2) = -a \\Rightarrow -(-1 - d^2) = -a \\Rightarrow 1 + d^2 = a \\]\n\nSince $d^2 = -2$ is not possible for real numbers, we must re-evaluate the problem constraints or assumptions. If we assume the problem meant to find the value of $a$ under the condition that the roots form an arithmetic sequence and satisfy the polynomial equation, we would typically look for values that fit within the context of the problem without contradictions. \n\nHowever, since the direct calculation from the given conditions leads to an impossible scenario, the problem might require additional context or clarification. Assuming the problem intended to find $a$ such that the roots form an arithmetic sequence and satisfy the polynomial equation, the correct approach would involve solving the system of equations derived from Vieta's formulas and the properties of the roots forming an arithmetic sequence. \n\nGiven the constraints and the nature of the problem, the most reasonable conclusion is that the value of $a$ cannot be determined directly from the provided information without further context or correction. Therefore, the problem as stated may need to be reconsidered or clarified.", "550_correct": false, "550_changed": false}

Let's denote this difference by \\( d(x) = f(x) - 1 \\). Then we have:\n\n\\[\nd(x f(x+1)) = d(x).\n\\]\n\nNext, let's substitute \\( x = 1 \\) into the original functional equation:\n\n\\[\nf(1 \\cdot f(1+y)) = y f(1) + 1,\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[\nf(f(y+1)) = y f(1) + 1.\n\\]\n\nNow, let's assume \\( f(1) = c \\).

If \\( f \\) were not injective, there would exist distinct \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) such that \\( f(a) = f(b) \\), but since \\( f \\) is one-to-one, \\( f(a+1) = f(b+1) \\) which contradicts \\( f(f(a+1)) = 1 \\neq f(f(b+1)) = 1 \\). Therefore, \\( f(1) = 0 \\) is not possible.\n\nNow suppose \\( f(1) > 0 \\).

Since \\( k > 0 \\), we have \\( k = 1 \\). From \\( km = m \\), we have \\( m = 0 \\). Finally, from \\( ky = my + 1 \\), we have \\( y = y + 1 \\), which is impossible unless \\( y = 0 \\), but \\( y \\) is a positive number. Therefore, \\( m = 0 \\) is also impossible. The only consistent solution is \\( f(x) = x + 1 \\).\n\nLet's verify \\( f(x) = x + 1 \\) in the original equation:\n\\[\nf(x f(x+y)) = f(x(x + 1 + y)) = f(x^2 + x + xy + 1) = x^2 + x + xy + 1 + 1 = x^2 + x + xy + 2,\n\\]\nand\n\\[\ny f(x) + 1 = y(x + 1) + 1 = xy + y + 1.\n\\]\n\nFor these two expressions to be equal, we need:\n\\[\nx^2 + x + xy + 2 = xy + y + 1 \\implies x^2 + x + 1 = y.\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( f(x) = x + 1 \\) is indeed a solution.

When point $A$ moves along the parabola $C$, all points not on the line $E F$ form a planar region $\\Omega$. Find the range of the area of region $\\Omega$.\nassistant\n[Think] To solve this problem, we need to analyze the geometric properties of the given parabola and circle, and how they interact when considering the tangents from a moving point on the parabola.\n\nFirstly, let's consider the equation of the parabola \\( C \\):\n\\[ y = \\frac{1}{2} x^2 \\]\n\nThe circle \\( D \\) has its center at \\( (0, \\frac{1}{2}) \\) and radius \\( r \\). The distance from the origin to the center of the circle is:\n\\[ \\sqrt{0^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\nFor the circles to have no common points, the distance between their centers must be greater than the sum or less than the difference of their radii. Therefore, for the circles to have no common points, we must have:\n\\[ 1 - r > \\frac{1}{2} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 1 - r < \\frac{1}{2} \\]\nSolving these inequalities, we get:\n\\[ r < \\frac{1}{2} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad r > \\frac{1}{4} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the locus of points \\( A \\) on the parabola such that the tangents from \\( A \\) to the circle do not intersect the line segment \\( EF \\). This means that the points \\( E \\) and \\( F \\) lie outside the circle but inside the parabola.\n\nWhen a point \\( A \\) on the parabola is connected to the circle by two tangents, the intersection points \\( E \\) and \\( F \\) will always lie on the line passing through the focus of the parabola and perpendicular to the directrix. For the parabola \\( y = \\frac{1}{2} x^2 \\), the focus is at \\( (0, \\frac{1}{8}) \\) and the directrix is the line \\( y = -\\frac{1}{8} \\).\n\nThe line connecting the focus to any point on the parabola can be parameterized as:\n\\[ y = \\frac{1}{2} x^2 + \\frac{1}{8} \\]\n\nThis line intersects the circle at points \\( E \\) and \\( F \\). The key observation here is that the region \\( \\Omega \\) formed by all points not on the line \\( EF \\) is bounded by the parabola and the circle. The maximum area of \\( \\Omega \\) occurs when the circle is just touching the parabola at one point, which happens when \\( r = \\frac{1}{4} \\).\n\nIn this case, the circle touches the parabola at exactly one point, and the region \\( \\Omega \\) is simply the area under the parabola up to the point of tangency. The area of this region is half the area of the triangle formed by the vertex of the parabola, the point of tangency, and the focus of the parabola.\n\nThe area of the triangle is:\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{1}{32} \\]\n\nTherefore, the area of the region \\( \\Omega \\) is:\n\\[ \\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}} \\]", "550_correct": false, "550_changed": false}

Therefore, if $|x| + |y| > \\pi$, then $\\frac{|x| + |y|}{\\pi} > 1$ and $\\arctan \\frac{|x| + |y|}{\\pi} > \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, which implies that $\\frac{\\pi}{4} - \\arctan \\frac{|x| + |y|}{\\pi} < 0$. In this case, the expression inside the square root is negative, and thus the entire left-hand side of the inequality is not defined in the real numbers. Therefore, we must consider only the case where $|x| + |y| \\leq \\pi$.\n\nNext, let's analyze the right-hand side of the inequality:\n\n$$\n\\tan^2 x + 1 \\leq \\sqrt{2} |\\tan x| (\\sin x + \\cos x)\n$$\n\nWe can rewrite the right-hand side using the identity $\\sin x + \\cos x = \\sqrt{2} \\sin (x + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$:\n\n$$\n\\tan^2 x + 1 \\leq \\sqrt{2} |\\tan x| \\cdot \\sqrt{2} \\sin (x + \\frac{\\pi}{4})\n$$\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\n$$\n\\tan^2 x + 1 \\leq 2 |\\tan x| \\sin (x + \\frac{\\pi}{4})\n$$\n\nNow, let's consider the function on both sides of the inequality. The left-hand side is always non-negative because it is the sum of two squares. The right-hand side is also non-negative because it is a product of two terms, one of which is bounded by its absolute value. To find the critical points, we need to check when equality holds. \n\nFor simplicity, let's assume $x = k\\pi$ or $y = k\\pi$ for some integer $k$. Then the left-hand side becomes zero, and the inequality simplifies to:\n\n$$\n0 \\leq 2 |\\tan k\\pi| \\sin (k\\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{4})\n$$\n\nSince $\\sin (k\\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{4}) = \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$, the inequality becomes:\n\n$$\n0 \\leq 2 |\\tan k\\pi| \\left( \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right) = \\mp \\sqrt{2} |\\tan k\\pi|\n$$\n\nThis is true if and only if $|\\tan k\\pi| = 0$, i.e., $k\\pi = n\\pi$ for some integer $n$, which means $k = n$. Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:\n\n$$\nx = y = n\\pi \\quad \\text{for } n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\n$$\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{x = y = n\\pi \\quad \\text{for } n \\in \\mathbb{Z}}\n$$", "550_correct": false, "550_changed": false}

The sum of the scores of the top four teams is $11 + 9 + 7 + 5 = 32$.\n\nSince each team plays against every other team exactly once, there are $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ matches played in total. Each match results in either one win for one team and one loss for the other, or a draw where both teams get 1 point. Therefore, the total number of points distributed among all teams is equal to the number of wins plus twice the number of draws (since each win gives 2 points and each draw gives 2 points).\n\nThe total number of points can also be calculated as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Total points} = \\left(\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\right) \\times 1 = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\n\\]\n\nWe know that the total points must be even because it is the sum of integers. Also, since the highest possible score for any team is 11 points, we have:\n\\[\n\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\geq 32\n\\]\nSolving this inequality, we find:\n\\[\nn^2 - n - 64 \\geq 0\n\\]\nThis quadratic equation has two solutions, but only the positive solution is relevant here:\n\\[\nn \\leq \\sqrt{64 + 1} = \\sqrt{65} \\approx 8.06\n\\]\nSince $n$ must be an integer, the maximum value for $n$ is 8. We need to check if $n=8$ satisfies our conditions:\n\nIf $n=8$, then the total number of points is:\n\\[\n\\frac{8(8-1)}{2} = 28\n\\]\nHowever, we know the total score should be 32, so $n=8$ does not work. Let's try $n=9$:\n\nIf $n=9$, then the total number of points is:\n\\[\n\\frac{9(9-1)}{2} = 36\n\\]\nThis is too high, so let's try $n=7$:\n\nIf $n=7$, then the total number of points is:\n\\[\n\\frac{7(7-1)}{2} = 21\n\\]\nThis is still too low, so let's try $n=6$:\n\nIf $n=6$, then the total number of points is:\n\\[\n\\frac{6(6-1)}{2} = 15\n\\]\nThis is much lower than 32, so $n=6$ is not correct. Finally, let's try $n=5$:\n\nIf $n=5$, then the total number of points is:\n\\[\n\\frac{5(5-1)}{2} = 10\n\\]\nThis is too low again, so $n=5$ is incorrect.

This can happen in two scenarios:\n1. The last chip drawn is red.\n2. Both green chips are drawn.\n\nFor scenario 1 (the last chip is red), we need to choose which of the 3 red chips will be the last one drawn. There are $\\binom{3}{1} = 3$ ways to do this. Then, we have 4 chips left, including the other 2 red chips and the 2 green ones, so there are $4! = 24$ ways to arrange these remaining chips. Therefore, there are $3 \\times 24 = 72$ ways for the last chip to be red.\n\nFor scenario 2 (both green chips are drawn), we need to choose which 2 out of the 3 red chips will be drawn first. There are $\\binom{3}{2} = 3$ ways to do this. Then, we have 4 chips left, including the other 2 red chips and the 2 green ones, so there are $4! / 2! = 12$ ways to arrange these remaining chips. Therefore, there are $3 \\times 12 = 36$ ways for both green chips to be drawn.\n\nAdding these together, there are $72 + 36 = 108$ ways for either the last chip to be red or both green chips to be drawn.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of possible outcomes when drawing all 5 chips. We have 5 positions to fill with 3 red chips and 2 green chips, so there are $5! = 120$ possible arrangements.\n\nThe probability that the 3 reds are drawn is therefore the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes:\n\n$$P(\\text{all reds}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \\frac{108}{120} = \\frac{9}{10}$$\n\nHowever, this calculation seems incorrect because it doesn't account for the fact that the order of drawing matters. Let's correct this by considering the different sequences where the 3 reds appear.\n\nThere are 3 red chips and 2 green chips, so there are 5 positions to fill. For each position, we can either draw a red chip or a green chip. If we want the 3 reds to appear, we must ensure they are not separated by a green chip. This means we cannot have a sequence like RGRGRR or GRGRR, but only sequences like RRGRG or RGRRG.\n\nLet's count the valid sequences:\n- RRGRG: 1 way\n- RGRGR: 1 way\n- RGRRG: 1 way\n- GRRRG: 1 way\n- GRGRG: 1 way\n- GGRRR: 1 way\n\nSo there are 6 valid sequences where the 3 reds appear consecutively.\n\nThe probability is now the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes:\n\n$$P(\\text{all reds}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \\frac{6}{10} = \\frac{3}{5}$$\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is $\\boxed{D}$.", "550_correct": false, "550_changed": false}

The value of \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{n!} \\right\\rfloor\\) is maximized when \\(x\\) is just less than \\(n!\\). For example:\n- When \\(n=1\\), \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{1!} \\right\\rfloor = x - 1\\).\n- When \\(n=2\\), \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{2!} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{2} \\right\\rfloor\\).\n\nWe can approximate the sum by considering the maximum possible values of these terms. If \\(x\\) were very large, all terms would be close to their maximum values, but since the sum must equal 1001, \\(x\\) cannot be too large. Let's try some values around this constraint.\n\nIf \\(x = 99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999", "550_correct": false, "550_changed": false}

Find the ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the pyramid, if the lateral edge of the pyramid makes an angle $\\alpha$ with the base plane.\nassistant\n[Think] To find the ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the pyramid, we need to consider the geometric properties and relationships between the cube and the pyramid.\n\n1. **Understanding the Geometry**:\n   - The cube is inscribed in the pyramid such that its upper base lies on the lateral edges.\n   - The vertices of the cube's lower base are in the plane of the pyramid's base.\n   - The lateral edge of the pyramid forms an angle \\(\\alpha\\) with the base plane.\n\n2. **Volume Calculations**:\n   - Let \\(V_c\\) be the volume of the cube.\n   - Let \\(V_p\\) be the volume of the pyramid.\n\n3. **Relationship Between Cube and Pyramid**:\n   - Since the cube is inscribed in the pyramid, the height of the pyramid can be expressed in terms of the side length of the cube and the angle \\(\\alpha\\).\n\n4. **Using Trigonometry**:\n   - Consider the right triangle formed by the height of the pyramid, half the diagonal of the square base of the pyramid, and the lateral edge of the pyramid.\n   - The height of the pyramid \\(h\\) can be related to the side length \\(a\\) of the cube using trigonometric functions.\n\n5. **Volume Formulas**:\n   - Volume of the cube: \\(V_c = a^3\\)\n   - Volume of the pyramid: \\(V_p = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{Base Area} \\times \\text{Height}\\)\n\n6. **Finding the Ratio**:\n   - The ratio of the volumes is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{V_c}{V_p} = \\frac{a^3}{\\left(\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{Base Area} \\times h\\right)}\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying further, we get:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{V_c}{V_p} = \\frac{a^3}{\\left(\\frac{1}{3} \\times (a\\sqrt{2})^2 \\times h\\right)} = \\frac{a^3}{\\left(\\frac{1}{3} \\times 2a^2 \\times h\\right)} = \\frac{a^3}{\\frac{2a^2h}{3}} = \\frac{3a}{2h}\n     \\]\n\n7. **Expressing \\(h\\) in Terms of \\(\\alpha\\)**:\n   - Using the relationship from trigonometry, we have:\n     \\[\n     h = \\frac{a}{\\sin \\alpha}\n     \\]\n   - Substituting this into the ratio:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{V_c}{V_p} = \\frac{3a}{2 \\cdot \\frac{a}{\\sin \\alpha}} = \\frac{3a \\sin \\alpha}{2a} = \\frac{3 \\sin \\alpha}{2}\n     \\]\n\n8. **Final Answer**:\n   - Therefore, the ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the pyramid is:\n     \\[\n     \\boxed{\\frac{3 \\sin \\alpha}{2}}\n     \\]", "550_correct": false, "550_changed": false}

Therefore, $B + C = 180^\\circ - A$.\n\nWe need to minimize the expression:\n\\[\n\\cos A (\\sin B + \\sin C)\n\\]\n\nUsing the identity $\\sin(180^\\circ - x) = \\sin x$, we have:\n\\[\n\\sin B + \\sin C = \\sin (180^\\circ - A) + \\sin C = \\sin A + \\sin C\n\\]\nThus, our expression becomes:\n\\[\n\\cos A (\\sin A + \\sin C)\n\\]\n\nNext, we will use the fact that in any triangle, the largest angle is opposite the longest side. Without loss of generality, assume $C$ is the largest angle. Then $C > 60^\\circ$ because if $C \\leq 60^\\circ$, the other two angles would each be less than or equal to $60^\\circ$, making their sum at most $120^\\circ$, which contradicts the fact that the sum of all angles in a triangle is $180^\\circ$.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when $C$ is very close to $90^\\circ$. If $C \\approx 90^\\circ$, then $\\sin C \\approx 1$ and $\\cos A \\approx 0$ (since $A$ must be acute). In this scenario, the product $\\cos A (\\sin A + \\sin C)$ approaches zero.\n\nHowever, since $C$ cannot actually reach $90^\\circ$ due to the constraint on the sum of angles being $180^\\circ$, we need to find the limit as $C$ gets closer to but does not reach $90^\\circ$. As $C$ approaches $90^\\circ$, $\\sin C$ approaches 1, and $\\cos A$ remains positive but very small. The term $\\sin A + \\sin C$ will still approach 1 from below, making the entire product approach 0.\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of $\\cos A (\\sin B + \\sin C)$ is indeed 0, achieved when one of the angles is $90^\\circ$ and the other two are complementary angles. This occurs when the triangle is right-angled, specifically when $C = 90^\\circ$ and $A + B = 90^\\circ$.\n\nSo, the minimum value is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]", "550_correct": false, "550_changed": false}

On how many arrays is this possible?\nassistant\nThink about it: The goal is to make all entries divisible by 2013 using the allowed operations. Let's consider the parity (odd or even) of the numbers in the array.\n\nInitially, every number can be either odd or even. Each operation changes the parity of the chosen row or column. Operation 1 decreases the parity of all entries in the chosen row, while Operation 2 increases the parity of all entries in the chosen column.\n\nTo achieve all entries being divisible by 2013, we need to ensure that after any sequence of these operations, all entries have the same parity. This means that if we start with some initial configuration, we must end up with all entries having the same parity (either all odd or all even).\n\nNow, let's count the number of such configurations:\n\n- There are \\(2^{2013}\\) ways to assign parities to the rows initially.\n- Similarly, there are \\(2^{2013}\\) ways to assign parities to the columns initially.\n\nSince the choices for rows and columns are independent, the total number of configurations is \\(2^{2013} \\times 2^{2013} = 2^{4026}\\).\n\nHowever, not all of these configurations will result in all entries being divisible by 2013. We need to exclude those configurations where at least one row or one column has all entries odd or all entries even.\n\nThe number of configurations where all entries in a specific row are odd is \\(2^{2012}\\), and similarly for columns. Since there are 2013 rows and 2013 columns, the number of configurations where at least one row or one column has all entries odd is \\(2^{2012} + 2^{2012} - 1\\) (we subtract 1 because both cases are counted once).\n\nThus, the number of valid configurations is \\(2^{4026} - (2^{2012} + 2^{2012} - 1)\\).\n\nSimplifying this expression gives us the final answer:\n\\[2^{4026} - 2^{2013} + 1\\]\n\nSo, on \\(2^{4026} - 2^{2013} + 1\\) arrays is this possible.", "550_correct": false, "550_changed": false}

The derivative of a polynomial changes the order of its roots. Specifically, if \\( r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_m \\) are the roots of \\( P(x) \\), then the roots of \\( P'(x) \\) are given by the formula:\n\n\\[ r_i' = -\\frac{P(r_i)}{P'(r_i)}, \\quad i = 1, 2, \\ldots, m. \\]\n\nThis means that the derivative \\( P'(x) \\) will introduce new roots where the original polynomial had none or only one root.

Let's try \\( x = 9 \\):\n\\[ f(9) = \\sqrt{9 + 27} + \\sqrt{13 - 9} + \\sqrt{9} = \\sqrt{36} + \\sqrt{4} + \\sqrt{9} = 6 + 2 + 3 = 11. \\]\n\nNow, we need to confirm that this is indeed the maximum value by considering other possible values of \\( x \\) within the interval \\( [0, 13] \\).\n\nFor \\( x > 13 \\), the term \\( \\sqrt{13 - x} \\) becomes negative, which is not allowed since all terms under the square root must be non-negative. Therefore, \\( x > 13 \\) is not a valid range for our function.\n\nFor \\( 0 \\leq x < 9 \\), the term \\( \\sqrt{13 - x} \\) can become negative, but it does not affect the sum because \\( \\sqrt{13 - x} \\) is always less than or equal to \\( \\sqrt{13} \\approx 3.605 \\), while \\( \\sqrt{x} \\) is always greater than or equal to 0.

Compute the sum of all values of $P(\\tfrac13)$ over all nonconstant polynomials $P$ satisfying the above constraint for this $c$.\nassistant\nThink about it like this:\n\nThe given equation is \\( P(z^2) = P(z - c)P(z + c) \\). This suggests that \\( P \\) has some special symmetry or periodicity.\n\nConsider the roots of \\( P \\), say \\( r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_n \\). Then we have:\n\\[ P(r_i^2) = P(r_i - c)P(r_i + c) \\]\nfor each root \\( r_i \\).\n\nIf \\( P \\) were to be a constant polynomial, it would not satisfy the condition because the left side would be zero while the right side would be positive unless \\( c = 0 \\). Therefore, \\( P \\) must be a non-constant polynomial.\n\nNow let's consider the case where \\( P \\) is a quadratic polynomial. Suppose \\( P(z) = az^2 + bz + d \\). Substituting into the original equation gives:\n\\[ a z^4 + b z^2 + d = (a(z-c)^2 + b(z-c) + d)(a(z+c)^2 + b(z+c) + d) \\]\n\nExpanding both sides and comparing coefficients will lead us to find specific relationships between \\( a, b, \\) and \\( d \\). However, solving these equations directly can be quite complex.\n\nInstead, let's try to find a simpler form of \\( P \\). Consider if \\( P \\) could be a product of linear factors. If so, then \\( P(z) = k(z-r_1)(z-r_2) \\cdots (z-r_m) \\) for some constants \\( k, r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_m \\).\n\nSubstituting this into the original equation and simplifying should reveal more about the structure of \\( P \\). \n\nAfter careful analysis, one finds that the only way to satisfy the equation for all \\( z \\) is if \\( P \\) is a polynomial of degree 2 with roots at \\( \\pm c \\). That is, \\( P(z) = k(z - c)(z + c) \\) for some constant \\( k \\).\n\nThus, the largest possible value of \\( c \\) is when \\( P \\) is a polynomial of degree 2 with roots at \\( \\pm c \\). The simplest such polynomial is \\( P(z) = z^2 - c^2 \\).\n\nFinally, we need to compute \\( P\\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right) \\):\n\\[ P\\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^2 - c^2 = \\frac{1}{9} - c^2 \\]\n\nSince \\( c \\) is maximized by the constraints of the problem, we conclude that the sum of all values of \\( P\\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right) \\) over all nonconstant polynomials \\( P \\) satisfying the given constraint is simply \\( \\frac{1}{9} - c^2 \\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\( \\boxed{\\frac{1}{9}} \\).", "550_correct": false, "550_changed": false}

The height of the truncated cone, which is also the distance from the center of the larger base to the vertex of the cone, is equal to the radius of the larger base, i.e., $h = R$. The perimeter of the regular hexagon circumscribed around the smaller base is equal to the perimeter of the equilateral triangle inscribed in the larger base.\n\nThe side length of the regular hexagon is equal to the diameter of the smaller base, so it is $2r$. The perimeter of this hexagon is therefore $6 \\cdot 2r = 12r$. Similarly, the side length of the equilateral triangle is also $2r$, so its perimeter is $3 \\cdot 2r = 6r$.\n\nSince these perimeters are equal, we have:\n\\[ 12r = 6r + h \\]\nSubstituting $h = R$, we get:\n\\[ 12r = 6r + R \\]\nSolving for $R$, we find:\n\\[ R = 6r \\]\n\nNow, let's determine the angle $\\alpha$ of inclination of the generatrix (slant height) of the truncated cone to the base plane. The slant height forms a right triangle with the height of the truncated cone and the difference between the radii of the bases.

Find the minimum number of angles under the given conditions.\nassistant\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the smallest set of angles at a point \\( O \\), each of which is a power of 5, such that their sum is exactly 360 degrees.\n\nFirst, let's list the powers of 5:\n\\[ 5^0 = 1, \\quad 5^1 = 5, \\quad 5^2 = 25, \\quad 5^3 = 125, \\quad 5^4 = 625 \\]\n\nWe need to find a combination of these numbers that add up to 360 degrees. Let's start by trying to use the largest possible angle, which is 625 degrees, but since it exceeds 360 degrees, we will try smaller combinations.\n\nLet's consider using 625 degrees once:\n\\[ 360 - 625 = -265 \\]\nThis is not possible because we cannot have negative angles.\n\nNext, let's try using 125 degrees twice:\n\\[ 360 - 125 - 125 = 110 \\]\nNow, we need to express 110 degrees as a sum of powers of 5. We can see that:\n\\[ 110 = 85 + 25 \\]\nSo, we can use 125 degrees three times:\n\\[ 360 - 125 - 125 - 125 = 0 \\]\nThis works perfectly.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of angles required is 3, where each angle is 125 degrees.

The expected number of excellent pairs after \\( n \\) rounds can be calculated using the binomial distribution. However, since we are looking for the minimum number of rounds, we can use the fact that the sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes must equal 1.\n\nFor \\( n \\) rounds, the expected number of excellent pairs is approximately \\( np_1^2 + np_2^2 \\), where \\( p_i^2 \\) is the probability that both players make their shots in one round. We want this to be at least 16.\n\nFirst, let's express \\( p_1^2 + p_2^2 \\):\n\\[ p_1^2 + p_2^2 = \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{9}{16} + \\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{81}{144} + \\frac{64}{144} = \\frac{145}{144} \\approx 1.017 \\]\n\nNow, we need \\( np_1^2 + np_2^2 \\geq 16 \\):\n\\[ n \\cdot \\frac{145}{144} \\geq 16 \\]\n\\[ n \\geq 16 \\cdot \\frac{144}{145} \\approx 16.8 \\]\n\nSince \\( n \\) must be an integer, we round up to the next whole number:\n\\[ n = 17 \\]\n\nTo verify, we check the probability of having exactly 16 excellent pairs out of 17 rounds:\n\\[ P(\\text{16 excellent pairs in 17 rounds}) \\approx \\binom{17}{16} \\left(\\frac{145}{144}\\right)^{16} \\left(\\frac{9}{144}\\right)^1 \\approx 17 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{145}{144}\\right)^{16} \\cdot \\frac{9}{144} \\approx 17 \\cdot 0.999 \\cdot 0.0625 \\approx 1 \\]\n\nThus, it is indeed possible to have 16 excellent pairs in 17 rounds.

Suppose \\( x \\) is rational. Then \\( x^2 \\) must be a perfect square. Let's assume \\( x = \\frac{p}{q} \\), where \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are coprime integers (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1). Therefore,\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{p}{q}\\right)^2 = \\sigma(1) + \\sqrt{\\sigma(2) + \\sqrt{\\cdots + \\sqrt{\\sigma(n)}}}\n\\]\n\nThis implies that \\( \\sigma(1) + \\sqrt{\\sigma(2) + \\sqrt{\\cdots + \\sqrt{\\sigma(n)}}} \\) must be a perfect square. Since \\( \\sigma(1) \\) is an integer, \\( \\sqrt{\\sigma(2) + \\sqrt{\\cdots + \\sqrt{\\sigma(n)}}} \\) must also be an integer. Let's denote this integer by \\( k \\):\n\n\\[\n\\sigma(1) + k = m^2\n\\]\n\nfor some integer \\( m \\). Now, consider the next term in the nested radical:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\sigma(2) + k} = l^2\n\\]\n\nfor some integer \\( l \\). Substituting back, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\sigma(1) + l^4 = m^2\n\\]\n\nSince \\( \\sigma(1) \\) is an integer, \\( l^4 - m^2 \\) must be zero or a multiple of \\( \\sigma(1) \\). The simplest case is when \\( l = 0 \\), so \\( k = 0 \\). This means:\n\n\\[\n\\sigma(1) = m^2\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\n\\sigma(2) = \\sigma(3) = \\cdots = \\sigma(n) = 0\n\\]\n\nHowever, since \\( \\sigma \\) is a permutation of \\( 1, 2, \\ldots, n \\), it cannot map all elements to zero. Therefore, \\( k \\neq 0 \\).\n\nNow, let's try another approach. Consider the case when \\( n = 1 \\). In this case, the expression simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{1} = 1\n\\]\n\nwhich is clearly a rational number. So, \\( n = 1 \\) works.\n\nNext, consider \\( n = 2 \\). We have two permutations: \\( (1, 2) \\) and \\( (2, 1) \\). For both permutations, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{1 + \\sqrt{2}} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{1}}\n\\]\n\nBoth of these expressions are irrational. Therefore, \\( n = 2 \\) does not work.\n\nFor \\( n > 2 \\), we can use the fact that if \\( n \\geq 3 \\), then the expression will involve nested radicals that do not simplify easily to a rational number. To see why, note that each step in the nested radical introduces new terms that are generally not expressible in simple form involving only rational numbers.\n\nThus, the only value of \\( n \\) that satisfies the condition is \\( n = 1 \\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]", "550_correct": false, "550_changed": false}

The area of each of these triangles will be proportional to the product of their bases (which are segments of the diagonals) and heights from the opposite vertices.\n\nThe height from vertex $A$ to diagonal $B C$ is denoted as $h_A$, and similarly for $D$.\n\nUsing the fact that the sum of the areas of triangles $A B O$ and $D C O$ is half the area of quadrilateral $A B C D$, we can write:\n$$ S_{A B C D} = 2(S_{A B O} + S_{D C O}) = 2 \\left(\\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{3}{2}\\right) = 6 $$\n\nHowever, this calculation assumes equal division of the diagonals, which may not necessarily hold true due to the specific angles involved.

This symmetry allows us to use trigonometric relationships directly without needing to explicitly solve for all sides or angles.\n\nIn this case, the smallest possible area of quadrilateral $A B C D$ is achieved when the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, resulting in the smallest possible non-zero area.

Let's denote this perfect square by \\( k^2 \\), where \\( k \\) is some integer. Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[\nk^2 = 512 + 2^n\n\\]\n\nRearranging the equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n2^n = k^2 - 512\n\\]\n\nSince \\( 2^n \\) must be a power of 2, \\( k^2 - 512 \\) must also be a power of 2. Notice that \\( 512 = 2^9 \\), so we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n\\[\n2^n = k^2 - 2^9\n\\]\n\nThis implies that \\( k^2 - 2^9 \\) must be a power of 2.

However, upon closer inspection, we realize that our initial assumption might have been incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the problem by considering the possibility that \\( n \\) could be negative or fractional, but since \\( n \\) must be an integer, we should check if there was any oversight in our approach.\n\nUpon further reflection, we realize that the correct approach involves recognizing that \\( 512 + 2^n \\) must be a perfect square.

Since \\( z \\) divides both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), let's write \\( x = az \\) and \\( y = bz \\) for some integer \\( a \\).

Let's analyze it further. If \\( a = 0 \\), then the equation simplifies to \\( 0 = ab^2 \\), which implies \\( b = 0 \\) or \\( a = 0 \\). But since \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are positive integers, \\( b = 0 \\) is not possible.

This means our assumption that \\( z > 2 \\) leads to contradictions unless \\( z = 2 \\).\n\nSo, the only possibility left is \\( z = 2 \\). Substituting \\( z = 2 \\) back into the original equation:\n\n\\[ x + y^2 + 8 = 2xy \\]\n\\[ x + y^2 + 8 = 2xy \\]\n\\[ x + y^2 - 2xy + 8 = 0 \\]\n\\[ (x - y)^2 + 8 = 0 \\]\n\nThe term \\((x - y)^2\\) is always non-negative, so the only way the sum can be zero is if both terms are zero.

If a permutation $b_{1}, b_{2}, \\cdots, b_{n}$ of these numbers satisfies: for any $k=1,2, \\cdots, n$, $b_{1}+b_{2}+\\cdots+b_{k}>0$, then this permutation is called good. Find the minimum number of good permutations. (2002\n\n\nassistant\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of good permutations for \\( n \\) distinct real numbers \\( a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n \\) such that their sum is positive and each permutation \\( b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n \\) where \\( b_i > a_i \\) has a strictly increasing order.\n\nFirst, let's consider the case when \\( n = 3 \\). We have three distinct real numbers \\( a_1, a_2, a_3 \\) with a positive sum. A permutation \\( b_1, b_2, b_3 \\) is good if \\( b_1 + b_2 + b_3 > 0 \\).\n\nOne way to construct a good permutation is to choose \\( b_1 = a_1 + 1 \\), \\( b_2 = a_2 + 1 \\), and \\( b_3 = a_3 + 1 \\). This ensures that \\( b_1 + b_2 + b_3 = (a_1 + 1) + (a_2 + 1) + (a_3 + 1) = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + 3 > 0 \\).\n\nNow, let's generalize this idea to \\( n \\) numbers. For \\( n \\) numbers, we can always find a permutation \\( b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n \\) such that \\( b_1 + b_2 + \\cdots + b_k > 0 \\) for all \\( k = 1, 2, \\ldots, n \\). One way to do this is to use the fact that among any \\( n \\) distinct real numbers, there exists a subset whose elements sum to more than zero. By choosing appropriate values for \\( b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n \\), we can ensure that the sum of any initial segment of the permutation is positive.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of good permutations is \\( n-1 \\). To see why, note that if we have \\( n \\) numbers, we can always find a permutation where the sum of the first \\( k \\) numbers is positive for all \\( k = 1, 2, \\ldots, n \\). This means that the last number must be negative or zero, but since the sum of all numbers is positive, it is impossible for the last number to be non-negative. Thus, the last number must be negative, which contradicts the requirement that the permutation is good.\n\nHence, the minimum number of good permutations is \\( n-1 \\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{n-1}\n\\]", "550_correct": false, "550_changed": false}

For $k=m$, let $t$ be the smallest positive integer such that Vera can guarantee, no matter what Marco does, that she wins after at most $t$ turns. Compute $100m + t$.\n\n[i]Proposed by Ashwin Sah[/i]\nassistant\nThink about the problem step-by-step:\n\nFirst, we need to understand the conditions under which Vera can win. Vera's strategy involves swapping the colors of neighboring cells multiple times until she forces Marco into a position where he cannot make a valid move. The key insight here is that Vera can always force Marco into a situation where he cannot satisfy his condition of having a black cell with more than two white neighbors.\n\nTo achieve this, Vera needs to ensure that her moves will eventually lead to a state where Marco cannot find any black cell with more than two white neighbors. One way to do this is to create a pattern of alternating black and white cells that makes it impossible for Marco to satisfy his condition.\n\nThe simplest way to do this is to use a checkerboard pattern, where every second row and column alternates between black and white. In this case, every black cell will have exactly two white neighbors, and every white cell will have exactly three black neighbors. Therefore, Marco will never be able to find a black cell with more than two white neighbors.\n\nNow, let's determine the minimum number of moves \\( k \\) required for Vera to guarantee her victory. Since the checkerboard pattern ensures that Marco cannot satisfy his condition, Vera can simply swap the colors of neighboring cells repeatedly until she achieves this pattern. It takes 2 moves to swap the colors of adjacent cells once, so Vera can guarantee her victory after 2 turns.\n\nThus, \\( m = 2 \\).\n\nNext, we need to find the smallest positive integer \\( t \\) such that Vera can guarantee her victory after at most \\( t \\) turns. As shown above, Vera can achieve her goal in just 2 turns using the checkerboard pattern. Therefore, \\( t = 2 \\).\n\nFinally, we compute \\( 100m + t \\):\n\n\\[ 100m + t = 100(2) + 2 = 202 \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\( \\boxed{202} \\).", "550_correct": false, "550_changed": false}

The key property here is that the inradius of a triangle can be expressed in terms of its area and semiperimeter. For a right triangle with legs $a$ and $b$, and hypotenuse $c$, the inradius $r$ is given by:\n\\[ r = \\frac{a + b - c}{2} \\]\nThe inradii of the smaller triangles formed by the altitude from the right angle to the hypotenuse (which divides the original triangle into two smaller right triangles) are related to the sides of these smaller triangles. Specifically, for the triangle $\\triangle ACD$ and $\\triangle BCD$, the inradii $r_1$ and $r_2$ are proportional to the segments created by the altitude on the hypotenuse. \n\nGiven that $C D$ is the median on the hypotenuse $A B$, it splits the hypotenuse into two equal parts, each of length $c/2$. This means that the smaller triangles $\\triangle ACD$ and $\\triangle BCD$ have sides that are half the lengths of the corresponding sides of the larger triangle $\\triangle ABC$. Therefore, the inradii of these smaller triangles will also be half the inradii of the larger triangle.\n\nThus, we have:\n\\[ r_1 = \\frac{r}{2}, \\quad r_2 = \\frac{r}{2} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the relationship between $r_1 + r_2$ and $kr$.

These perpendiculars will intersect \\(AD\\) at points \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) respectively.\n\n3. **Use Similar Triangles**:\n   - In triangles \\(APB\\) and \\(AQD\\), since both have a right angle and share the same hypotenuse \\(AD\\), they are similar by AA similarity criterion.\n   - Therefore, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{AP}{AQ} = \\frac{AB}{AD}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\frac{BP}{CQ} = \\frac{BC}{AD}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Express \\(AD\\) in Terms of Known Sides**:\n   - Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \\(ABC\\):\n     \\[\n     AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     AC^2 = 3^2 + 5^2 = 9 + 25 = 34\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     AC = \\sqrt{34}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Find the Length of \\(AD\\)**:\n   - Since \\(AD\\) is the sum of \\(AP\\) and \\(PD\\), where \\(PD\\) is the projection of \\(AC\\) onto \\(AD\\):\n     \\[\n     AD = AP + PD\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     AD = \\sqrt{AB^2 + BP^2} + \\sqrt{AC^2 - CP^2}\n     \\]\n     However, this approach seems overly complex. Instead, consider using the fact that the area of a trapezoid can be calculated directly if the lengths of its parallel sides and the distance between them (height) are known.\n\n6. **Area Formula for Trapezoids**:\n   - The area \\(A\\) of a trapezoid is given by:\n     \\[\n     A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (\\text{sum of parallel sides}) \\times \\text{height}\n     \\]\n   - Here, the parallel sides are \\(AB\\) and \\(CD\\), and the height is \\(h\\).\n\n7. **Calculate the Area**:\n   - First, find the length of \\(CD\\) using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \\(BCD\\):\n     \\[\n     BD^2 = BC^2 + CD^2\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     BD^2 = 5^2 + 7^2 = 25 + 49 = 74\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     BD = \\sqrt{74}\n     \\]\n\n8. **Relate \\(BD\\) to \\(AD\\)**:\n   - Since \\(BD\\) is the hypotenuse of right triangle \\(ABD\\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem again:\n     \\[\n     AD^2 = AB^2 + BD^2\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     AD^2 = 3^2 + 74 = 9 + 74 = 83\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     AD = \\sqrt{83}\n     \\]\n\n9. **Final Calculation**:\n   - Now, substitute the values into the area formula:\n     \\[\n     A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (AB + CD) \\times h\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (3 + 7) \\times h\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 10 \\times h\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     A = 5h\n     \\]\n\n10. **Determine \\(h\\)**:\n    - To find \\(h\\), note that it is the altitude of the right trapezoid formed by dropping perpendiculars from \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) to \\(AD\\).

P lies on the segment MC, and Q lies on the segment NB. R is the orthocenter of ABP and S is the orthocenter of ACQ. The lines BP and CQ meet at T. Find all possible values for angle BCQ such that RST is equilateral.\nassistant\n[hide=Solution]Think about the geometric properties and relationships involved in this problem.\n\nFirstly, since $ABC$ is an equilateral triangle, we know that $\\angle BAC = \\angle ABC = \\angle ACB = 60^\\circ$. Also, because $M$ and $N$ are midpoints, $AM = BM = CN = BN$, which means that triangles AMB and ANC are also equilateral.\n\nNow consider the points $R$ and $S$. Since $R$ is the orthocenter of $\\triangle ABP$, it follows that $\\angle ARB = 90^\\circ - \\angle APB$. Similarly, since $S$ is the orthocenter of $\\triangle ACQ$, it follows that $\\angle ASC = 90^\\circ - \\angle AQC$.\n\nThe key observation here is that if $RST$ is to be equilateral, then the angles $\\angle RST$, $\\angle STR$, and $\\angle RTS$ must each be $60^\\circ$. This implies that $\\angle RST + \\angle STR + \\angle RTS = 180^\\circ$, so each of these angles must individually equal $60^\\circ$.\n\nThis gives us three equations:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\angle RST = 60^\\circ \\\\\n&\\angle STR = 60^\\circ \\\\\n&\\angle RTS = 60^\\circ\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nSince $\\angle RST = 60^\\circ$, we have $\\angle BRC = 60^\\circ$. Similarly, since $\\angle STR = 60^\\circ$, we have $\\angle CSN = 60^\\circ$. And finally, since $\\angle RTS = 60^\\circ$, we have $\\angle BRN = 60^\\circ$.\n\nThese conditions imply that $\\angle BCR = \\angle CRN = \\angle NRB = 60^\\circ$. Therefore, quadrilateral $BCNR$ is cyclic (i.e., its vertices lie on a common circle). In a cyclic quadrilateral, opposite angles sum to $180^\\circ$, so $\\angle BNC + \\angle BCR = 180^\\circ$. But we already know that $\\angle BCR = 60^\\circ$, so $\\angle BNC = 120^\\circ$.\n\nNow, let's look at the line segments $BP$ and $CQ$. These intersect at point $T$. Since $\\angle BNC = 120^\\circ$, we can use the fact that the measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles. So, $\\angle BTC = \\angle BNC - \\angle BCT = 120^\\circ - \\angle BCT$.\n\nSimilarly, $\\angle CTN = \\angle CST - \\angle SCN = 120^\\circ - \\angle SCN$. Now, since $\\angle CST = \\angle BCS = 60^\\circ$ (because $C$ is the circumcenter of $\\triangle BPC$), we have $\\angle CTN = 120^\\circ - 60^\\circ = 60^\\circ$. Thus, $\\angle BTC = 120^\\circ - 60^\\circ = 60^\\circ$.\n\nFinally, since $\\angle BTC = 60^\\circ$, we have $\\angle BTA = 180^\\circ - \\angle BTC = 120^\\circ$. But $\\angle BTA$ is actually half of the angle subtended by arc $BT$ at the circumference, so $\\angle BTW = 240^\\circ$, where $W$ is the intersection of $AT$ and $BS$.\n\nTherefore, the only way for $RST$ to be equilateral is if $\\angle BCQ = 75^\\circ$. This is because $\\angle BQC = 180^\\circ - \\angle BCQ - \\angle BQC = 180^\\circ - 75^\\circ - 75^\\circ = 30^\\circ$, and $\\angle BQT = 180^\\circ - \\angle BTA - \\angle ATQ = 180^\\circ - 120^\\circ - 60^\\circ = 0^\\circ$, which is not possible. However, if we consider the reflection of $Q$ over $AB$, we get a new point $Q'$ such that $\\angle BQ'Q = 75^\\circ$. This means that $\\angle BCQ = 75^\\circ$ is indeed the correct value.", "550_correct": false, "550_changed": false}

Consider the term \\(\\frac{a\\left(b^{2}+1\\right)}{a+b}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a\\left(b^{2}+1\\right)}{a+b} = \\frac{ab^2 + a}{a+b} = ab + \\frac{a}{a+b}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, for the other terms:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b\\left(c^{2}+1\\right)}{b+c} = bc + \\frac{b}{b+c}, \\quad \\frac{c\\left(a^{2}+1\\right)}{c+a} = ca + \\frac{c}{c+a}\n\\]\n\nThus, the original expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n(ab + \\frac{a}{a+b}) + (bc + \\frac{b}{b+c}) + (ca + \\frac{c}{c+a})\n\\]\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\n\\[\nab + bc + ca + \\frac{a}{a+b} + \\frac{b}{b+c} + \\frac{c}{c+a}\n\\]\n\nNext, we use the condition \\(a b + b c + c a = 1\\) to find a relationship between the fractions.

The graphs of the functions $y=x^{2}-x$ and $y=\\cos 10 \\pi x(x \\geqslant 0)$ intersect at $\\qquad$ points.\nassistant\nTo determine the number of intersection points between the graphs of the functions \\( y = x^2 - x \\) and \\( y = \\cos(10\\pi x) \\), we need to solve the equation:\n\n\\[ x^2 - x = \\cos(10\\pi x) \\]\n\nFirst, let's analyze the behavior of each function:\n- The function \\( y = x^2 - x \\) is a parabola opening upwards with its vertex at \\( x = \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n- The function \\( y = \\cos(10\\pi x) \\) oscillates between -1 and 1 with a period of \\( \\frac{2\\pi}{10\\pi} = \\frac{1}{5} \\).\n\nNext, we will find the intersections by considering the periodicity and symmetry of the cosine function.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Find the roots of the quadratic equation:**\n   \\[ x^2 - x = 0 \\]\n   Factorize:\n   \\[ x(x - 1) = 0 \\]\n   So, the solutions are:\n   \\[ x = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = 1 \\]\n\n2. **Check if these roots satisfy the cosine condition:**\n   For \\( x = 0 \\):\n   \\[ \\cos(10\\pi \\cdot 0) = \\cos(0) = 1 \\neq 0 \\]\n   Therefore, \\( x = 0 \\) is not a solution.\n\n   For \\( x = 1 \\):\n   \\[ \\cos(10\\pi \\cdot 1) = \\cos(10\\pi) = \\cos(0) = 1 \\neq 1 \\]\n   Therefore, \\( x = 1 \\) is not a solution either.\n\n3. **Consider the general case for non-zero \\( x \\):**\n   We need to check when \\( x^2 - x = \\cos(10\\pi x) \\). Since \\( \\cos(10\\pi x) \\) ranges from -1 to 1, we have:\n   \\[ -1 \\leq \\cos(10\\pi x) \\leq 1 \\]\n   This implies:\n   \\[ -1 \\leq x^2 - x \\leq 1 \\]\n\n4. **Solve the inequality:**\n   First, solve \\( x^2 - x \\leq 1 \\):\n   \\[ x^2 - x - 1 \\leq 0 \\]\n   Solve the corresponding quadratic equation:\n   \\[ x^2 - x - 1 = 0 \\]\n   Using the quadratic formula \\( x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\):\n   \\[ x = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 4}}{2} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\]\n   Thus, the roots are:\n   \\[ x_1 = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}, \\quad x_2 = \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\]\n\n   Now, solve \\( x^2 - x \\geq -1 \\):\n   \\[ x^2 - x + 1 \\geq 0 \\]\n   The discriminant of this quadratic equation is:\n   \\[ (-1)^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = 1 - 4 = -3 \\]\n   Since the discriminant is negative, there are no real roots. Therefore, \\( x^2 - x + 1 > 0 \\) for all real \\( x \\).\n\n5. **Combine the results:**\n   From the above analysis, we see that \\( x^2 - x \\) takes values in the interval \\([-1, 1]\\) only when \\( x \\) lies within the intervals where both conditions are satisfied simultaneously. However, since \\( x^2 - x \\) is always positive for \\( x \\in [0, 1] \\) and zero at \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( x = 1 \\), it never equals -1 or 1 except at those specific points.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   There are exactly two distinct points of intersection because \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( x = 1 \\) are the only integer solutions within one period of the cosine function, and they do not satisfy the equality \\( x^2 - x = \\cos(10\\pi x) \\) outside their respective intervals.\n\nTherefore, the graphs of the functions \\( y = x^2 - x \\) and \\( y = \\cos(10\\pi x) \\) intersect at \\(\\", "550_correct": false, "550_changed": true}
