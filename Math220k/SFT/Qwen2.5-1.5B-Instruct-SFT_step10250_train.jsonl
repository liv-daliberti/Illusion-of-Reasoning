Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nPart (a) asks: Find all positive integers n such that for every integer k with 1 ≤ k ≤ n, we have a_{k n} = a_n.\n\nSo, for example, take n=1. Then the condition becomes a_{k*1} = a_1 for all k from 1 to 1. That is, a_k = a_1 for all k=1. Since a_1=1, this is true. So n=1 works.\n\nFor n=2, the condition must hold for k=1 and k=2. So a_{2*1} = a_2 and a_{2*2} = a_2. Which is a_2 = a_2, so that's okay. So n=2 also works.\n\nWait, but according to the earlier analysis, n=2 is okay. Let's check n=3. For k=1, a_3 = a_1 =1. For k=2, a_{3*2} = a_6. According to the definition, a_6 = a_"}

We need to find the angles of the triangle.\n\nFirst, let's recall some basic properties of triangles and altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side. The length of the altitude is related to the area of the triangle: if h_a is the altitude corresponding to side a, then the area (A) is (1/2)*a*h_a.\n\nGiven that two altitudes are not smaller than the sides to which they are dropped. Let's denote the triangle as ABC, with sides a, b, c opposite to angles A, B, C respectively. Then, the altitudes correspond to these sides would be h_a, h_b, h_c. The problem states that at least two of these altitudes are not smaller than the corresponding sides. That is, either h_a ≥ a or h_b ≥ b, or h_c ≥ c.\n\nOur goal is to find the angles of such a triangle. Let's consider different cases where two altitudes are non-negative compared to their respective sides.\n\nCase 1: Suppose h_a ≥ a. Then, since h_a = 2Δ / a, where Δ is the area, we have 2Δ / a ≥ a ⇒ 2Δ ≥ a² ⇒ Δ ≥ a²/2. Similarly, for h_b ≥ b, 2Δ / b ≥ b ⇒ 2Δ ≥ b² ⇒ Δ ≥ b²/2. For h_c ≥ c, 2Δ / c ≥ c ⇒ 2Δ ≥ c² ⇒ Δ ≥ c²/2.\n\nBut since Δ is the same for all three altitudes and sides, we can write Δ ≥ max(a²/2, b²/2, c²/2). However, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, since the triangle has two altitudes not smaller than the corresponding sides, perhaps the triangle is isoceles? Wait, no. If two altitudes are equal to or larger than their corresponding sides, maybe the triangle is isoceles? Let's test this.\n\nSuppose the triangle is isoceles with sides a = b. Then, the altitude h_a would be from vertex A to side BC. Since sides a and b are equal, the altitude h_a would be shorter than a. But the problem states that h_a is not smaller than a. So this contradicts. Therefore, the triangle cannot be isoceles with two altitudes not smaller than the corresponding sides. Hence, Case 1 is impossible.\n\nTherefore, the two altitudes must be one greater than or equal to their corresponding sides, and the other must be less. Let's suppose h_a ≥ a and h_b < b. Then, similar logic applies.\n\nLet me formalize this. Let’s assume h_a ≥ a and h_b < b. Then, using the formula for altitude: h_a = 2Δ / a, h_b = 2Δ / b. Given h_a ≥ a, so 2Δ / a ≥ a ⇒ Δ ≥ a³ / 2. Similarly, h_b < b ⇒ 2Δ / b < b ⇒ Δ < b² / 2. But Δ ≥ max(a³ / 2, b² / 2). But since Δ is the same, we have Δ ≥ max(a³ / 2, b² / 2).

Alternatively, maybe using the formula for the area in terms of sides and angles.\n\nRecall that the area Δ = (1/2)ab sin C, where a and b are two sides and C is the included angle. Similarly, Δ = (1/2)ac sin B, and Δ = (1/2)bc sin A.\n\nGiven that h_a = 2Δ / a, h_b = 2Δ / b, h_c = 2Δ / c.\n\nFrom the problem statement, h_a ≥ a and h_b ≥ b.
