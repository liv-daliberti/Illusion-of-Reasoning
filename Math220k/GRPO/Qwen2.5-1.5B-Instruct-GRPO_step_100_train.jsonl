Let's also denote the number of mushrooms each child has as \\( m \\).\n\nFrom the first condition, if Anya gives half of her mushrooms to Vitya, all the children will have the same number of mushrooms. This means that after giving half of her mushrooms to Vitya, Anya will have \\( \\frac{A}{2} \\) mushrooms left, and each child will have \\( m + \\frac{A}{2n} \\) mushrooms. Since this is the same for all children, we can write:\n\\[ m + \\frac{A}{2n} = m \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ \\frac{A}{2n} = 0 \\]\nThis implies that \\( A = 0 \\), which is not possible since Anya has mushrooms. Instead, we should consider the second condition, where Anya gives all her mushrooms to Sasha, and Sasha will have as many mushrooms as all the others combined. This means that after giving all her mushrooms to Sasha, Anya will have \\( A - m \\) mushrooms left, and Sasha will have \\( A \\) mushrooms. The remaining \\( n-1 \\) children will have \\( m \\) mushrooms each. So, we can write:\n\\[ A - m = (n-1)m \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ A = (n-1)m + m \\]\n\\[ A = nm \\]\nNow, we know that Anya has \\( A \\) mushrooms and she gives half of them to Vitya, so Vitya will have \\( \\frac{A}{", "100_correct": false, "100_changed": true}

Let S be the set of 2 x 2 matrices over F with trace 1 and determinant 0. Find |S|. Solution\nassistant\n<think>\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand the structure of the set \\( S \\) of 2x2 matrices over the field \\( F \\) with \\( p \\) elements, where the trace is 1 and the determinant is 0. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Trace Condition:**\n   The trace of a matrix \\( A = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\) is given by \\( a + d \\). For the trace to be 1, we have:\n   \\[\n   a + d = 1\n   \\]\n\n2. **Understanding the Determinant Condition:**\n   The determinant of \\( A \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\det(A) = ad - bc = 0\n   \\]\n\n3. **Expressing the Determinant Condition:**\n   From the determinant condition, we can express \\( d \\) in terms of \\( a \\):\n   \\[\n   d = \\frac{bc}{a}\n   \\]\n   Since \\( a + d = 1 \\), we substitute \\( d \\):\n   \\[\n   a + \\frac{bc}{a} = 1\n   \\]\n   Multiplying through by \\( a \\) to clear the fraction:\n   \\[\n   a^2 + bc = a\n   \\]\n   Rearranging gives:\n   \\[\n   a^2 - a + bc = 0\n   \\]\n\n4. **Counting the Matrices:**\n   We need to count the number of solutions to this equation in the field \\( F \\) with \\( p \\) elements. The equation \\( a^2 - a + bc = 0 \\) can be rewritten as:\n   \\[\n   a^2 - a = -bc\n   \\]\n   This is a quadratic equation in \\( a \\). For each \\( a \\in F \\), \\( bc \\) must be such that the equation has a solution in \\( F \\).\n\n5. **Counting the Solutions:**\n   For each \\( a \\in F \\), the equation \\( a^2 - a = -bc \\) has solutions if and only if \\( -bc \\) is a quadratic residue in \\( F \\). Since \\( F \\) has \\( p \\) elements, there are \\( \\frac{p-1}{2} \\) quadratic residues and \\( \\frac{p-1}{2} \\) non-residues.

We need to find the integer value of $x$ that satisfies this equation.\n\nLet's start by considering the smallest possible value of $x$ that could satisfy the equation. Since $1! = 1$, the smallest term in the sum is $\\left[\\frac{x}{1}\\right] = x$. Therefore, the sum of the first term alone is $x$.\n\nFor the sum to equal 1001, $x$ must be at least 1001.

This term is less than $x$ but still contributes to the sum. We need to find a value of $x$ such that the sum of the first two terms is just less than 1001.\n\nLet's try $x = 1000$.

Let's denote the side length of the cube as \\(a\\). The cube is inscribed in the pyramid such that its upper base lies on the lateral edges and its lower base is in the plane of the pyramid's base.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the relationship between the side length of the cube and the dimensions of the pyramid.

This angle \\(\\alpha\\) is crucial in determining the height of the pyramid and the side length of the cube.\n\nThe height of the pyramid can be expressed in terms of the side length of the cube and the angle \\(\\alpha\\). The height \\(h\\) of the pyramid can be found using the right triangle formed by the height of the pyramid, the lateral edge, and the projection of the lateral edge onto the base plane. The projection of the lateral edge onto the base plane is the side length of the cube, \\(a\\).\n\nUsing trigonometry, we have:\n\\[ h = a \\cot \\alpha \\]\n\nThe volume \\(V_{\\text{cube}}\\) of the cube is:\n\\[ V_{\\text{cube}} = a^3 \\]\n\nThe volume \\(V_{\\text{pyramid}}\\) of the pyramid is:\n\\[ V_{\\text{pyramid}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{Base Area} \\times \\text{Height} \\]\nThe base area of the pyramid is the area of the square base, which is \\(a^2\\).

Then the equation becomes:\n\\[5x - 7x^2 + 8\\sqrt{y} = 8.\\]\nRearranging terms, we get:\n\\[8\\sqrt{y} = 7x^2 - 5x + 8.\\]\nNow, we can square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\\[(8\\sqrt{y})^2 = (7x^2 - 5x + 8)^2.\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[64y = (7x^2 - 5x + 8)^2.\\]\nSubstituting back \\(y = 7x^2 - 5x + 1\\), we get:\n\\[64(7x^2 - 5x + 1) = (7x^2 - 5x + 8)^2.\\]\nExpanding both sides, we have:\n\\[448x^2 - 320x + 64 = 49x^4 - 70x^3 + 112x^2 - 80x + 64.\\]\nRearranging all terms to one side, we get:\n\\[49x^4 - 70x^3 + 112x^2 - 320x + 64x - 64 + 64 = 0,\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[49x^4 - 70x^3 + 112x^2 - 256x = 0.\\]\nFactoring out \\(x\\), we get:\n\\[x(49x^3 - 70x^2 + 112x - 256) = 0.\\]\nThis gives us one solution \\(x = 0\\).

He is allowed two operations:\n1. Choose a row, and subtract 1 from each entry.\n2. Chooses a column, and add 1 to each entry.\nHe would like to get an array where all integers are divisible by 2013. On how many arrays is this possible?\nassistant\n<think>\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the properties of the operations and the constraints on the final array. The key insight is that the operations can be used to transform the array in a way that preserves the divisibility by 2013.\n\nFirst, let's consider the effect of the operations on the array. Subtracting 1 from each entry in a row or adding 1 to each entry in a column will change the parity (odd/even nature) of the entries in that row or column. However, the overall parity of the array will remain the same because the operations are symmetric in terms of row and column operations.\n\nSince 2013 is an odd number, the parity of the array will be odd if and only if the number of odd entries in the array is odd. This is because subtracting 1 from an odd number results in an even number, and adding 1 to an even number results in an odd number. Therefore, the parity of the array will be odd if and only if the number of odd entries is odd.\n\nNow, let's consider the total number of entries in the array, which is \\(2013 \\times 2013 = 2013^2\\). Since 2013 is odd, \\(2013^2\\) is also odd. Therefore, the number of odd entries in the array must be odd for the array to be divisible by 2013.\n\nThe total number of entries in the array is \\(2013^2\\), and half of these entries are odd (since \\(2013^2\\) is odd, half of the entries will be odd). Therefore, the number of odd entries in the array is \\(\\frac{2013^2}{2}\\).\n\nSince \\(\\frac{2013^2}{2}\\) is an integer, it is possible to have an array where all integers are divisible by 2013. Therefore, the number of arrays that are possible is \\(\\frac{2013^2}{2}\\).\n</think>\n<answer>\n\\(\\frac{2013^2}{2}\\)\n</answer>", "100_correct": false, "100_changed": false}

We added and subtracted $4$ to the expression $xy + 3 - 2x - 2y$ to facilitate factoring, and then we used the fact that $(x - 1)^2 + (y - 1)^2 \\ge 0$ to conclude that the left side of the original inequality is greater than or equal to $4$, which is greater than or equal to $2x + 2y$.\n</answer>"}

Let's start by analyzing the equation and considering the properties of prime numbers.\n</think>\n<answer>\nWe start by examining the equation \\((p+1)(q+2)(r+3) = 4pqr\\). Since \\(p, q, r\\) are prime numbers, we can consider the possible values for \\(p, q, r\\) and check if they satisfy the equation.\n\nFirst, let's consider the case where one of the primes is 2, the smallest prime number. If \\(p = 2\\), the equation becomes \\((2+1)(q+2)(r+3) = 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot q \\cdot r\\), which simplifies to \\(3(q+2)(r+3) = 8qr\\).\n\nNow, let's try to find specific values for \\(q\\) and \\(r\\) that satisfy this equation. We can start by testing small prime values for \\(q\\) and \\(r\\).\n\nIf \\(q = 3\\), the equation becomes \\(3(3+2)(r+3) = 8 \\cdot 3 \\cdot r\\), which simplifies to \\(3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot (r+3) = 24r\\), or \\(15(r+3) = 24r\\). Solving for \\(r\\), we get \\(15r + 45 = 24r\\), or \\(9r = 45\\), which gives \\(r = 5\\).\n\nSo, one solution is \\((p, q, r) = (2, 3, 5)\\). Let's verify this solution:\n\\[\n(2+1)(3+2)(5+3) = 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 8 = 120,\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 = 120.\n\\]\nSince both sides are equal, \\((2, 3, 5)\\) is indeed a solution.\n\nNext, let's consider the case where \\(p = 3\\). The equation becomes \\((3+1)(q+2)(r+3) = 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot q \\cdot r\\), which simplifies to \\(4(q+2)(r+3) = 12qr\\).\n\nIf \\(q = 2\\), the equation becomes \\(4(2+2)(r+3) = 12 \\cdot 2 \\cdot r\\), which simplifies to \\(4 \\cdot 4 \\cdot (r+3) = 24r\\), or \\(16(r+3) = 24r\\). Solving for \\(r\\), we get \\(16r + 48 = 24r\\), or \\(8r = 48\\), which gives \\(r = 6\\), but 6 is not a prime number. Therefore, \\(q = 2\\) is not a valid solution.\n\nIf \\(q = 5\\), the equation becomes \\(4(5+2)(r+3) = 12 \\cdot 5 \\cdot r\\), which simplifies to \\(4 \\cdot 7 \\cdot (r+3) = 60r\\), or \\(28(r+3) = 60r\\). Solving for \\(r\\), we get \\(28r + 84 = 60r\\), or \\(32r = 84\\), which gives \\(r = \\frac{84}{32} = \\frac{21}{8}\\), which is not an integer. Therefore, \\(q = 5\\) is not a valid solution.\n\nWe can continue this process for other prime values of \\(p, q, r\\), but it becomes increasingly complex and time-consuming. However, we have found one valid solution: \\((2, 3, 5)\\).\n\nTo ensure there are no other solutions, we can consider the general form of the equation and the properties of prime numbers. The equation \\((p+1)(q+2)(r+3) = 4pqr\\) is quite restrictive, and given the constraints of prime numbers, it is unlikely to have other solutions besides \\((2, 3, 5)\\).\n\nTherefore, the only solution is \\((2, 3, 5)\\).\n</answer>"}

When a point is symmetric to another point with respect to the x-axis, their x-coordinates remain the same, and their y-coordinates are negatives of each other. Similarly, when a point is symmetric to another point with respect to the y-axis, their y-coordinates remain the same, and their x-coordinates are negatives of each other.\n\nGiven that point $P_{1}(3, a)$ is symmetric to point $P_{2}(b, -2)$ with respect to the x-axis, we can deduce the following:\n- The x-coordinate of $P_{1}$ is the same as the x-coordinate of $P_{2}$, so $3 = b$.\n- The y-coordinate of $P_{1}$ is the negative of the y-coordinate of $P_{2}$, so $a = -(-2) = 2$.\n\nNow, to find the coordinates of the point $P_{1}$ symmetric to the y-axis, we change the sign of the x-coordinate while keeping the y-coordinate the same. So, the symmetric point to $P_{1}(3, 2)$ with respect to the y-axis is $P_{3}(3, 2)$.\n\nTo find the coordinates of the point $P_{1}$ symmetric to the origin, we change the signs of both the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate.

Let's start by understanding the given information and the relationships between the circles and the segment $O_1O_2$.\n</think>\n<answer>\nLet's denote the length of the segment $O_1O_2$ as $d$. Since $A$ and $B$ are points of intersection of the smaller and larger circles with the segment $O_1O_2$, we can use the power of a point theorem. The power of point $T$ with respect to both circles is the same, which is the product of the segments of the intersecting chords.\n\nFor the smaller circle, the power of point $T$ is $TA \\cdot TB = r_1^2 - OT^2 = 6^2 - OT^2 = 36 - OT^2$.\n\nFor the larger circle, the power of point $T$ is $TO \\cdot TO_2 = r_2^2 - OT^2 = 4^2 - OT^2 = 16 - OT^2$.\n\nSince $A$ and $B$ are points of intersection, we have $TA = \\frac{d}{3}$ and $TB = \\frac{2d}{3}$. Therefore, the power of point $T$ for the smaller circle is $\\left(\\frac{d}{3}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2d}{3}\\right) = \\frac{2d^2}{9}$.\n\nSetting the two expressions for the power of point $T$ equal to each other, we get:\n\\[\n\\frac{2d^2}{9} = 36 - OT^2\n\\]\nSince $OT$ is the distance from the center of the smaller circle to the point $T$, and $OT$ is the same for both circles, we can use the fact that $OT$ is the same for both circles. Let's denote $OT$ as $x$. Then we have:\n\\[\n\\frac{2d^2}{9} = 36 - x^2\n\\]\nWe also know that $d \\geq 6$ and $x$ is the distance from the center of the smaller circle to the point $T$.

Let's start by identifying the angles around the point where the lines intersect. The angles around the point are 120 degrees, 120 degrees, and 120 degrees. The sum of these angles is 360 degrees. The angle $x$ is part of a triangle formed by these angles. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, we can set up the equation:\n\\[120 + 120 + 120 + x = 180\\]\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\\[360 + x = 180\\]\nSubtracting 360 from both sides, we find:\n\\[x = 180 - 360\\]\n\\[x = -180\\]\nThis seems incorrect because we need to consider the correct angle relationships.

If \\( a = b \\), then \\( a^2 + b^2 = 2a^2 \\) and \\( a + b = 2a \\). Substituting these into the equation, we get:\n\\[ 3 = k^2 (2a^2) + k (2a) = 2k^2 a^2 + 2ka. \\]\n\nSince \\( a^2 = 1 \\) (because \\( a = b \\) and \\( ab = 1 \\)), we have:\n\\[ 3 = 2k^2 + 2ka. \\]\n\nWe can solve this quadratic equation for \\( k \\):\n\\[ 2k^2 + 2ka - 3 = 0. \\]\n\nUsing the quadratic formula \\( k = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\), where \\( a = 2 \\), \\( b = 2a \\), and \\( c = -3 \\), we get:\n\\[ k = \\frac{-2a \\pm \\sqrt{(2a)^2 - 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot (-3)}}{2 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{-2a \\pm \\sqrt{4a^2 + 24}}{4} = \\frac{-2a \\pm 2\\sqrt{a^2 + 6}}{4} = \\frac{-a \\pm \\sqrt{a^2 + 6}}{2}. \\]\n\nSince \\( k \\) is positive, we take the positive root:\n\\[ k = \\frac{-a + \\sqrt{a^2 + 6}}{2}. \\]\n\nTo find the maximum value of \\( k \\), we need to maximize \\( \\sqrt{a^2 + 6} \\). Since \\( a \\) is positive, the maximum value of \\( \\sqrt{a^2 + 6} \\) is when \\( a \\) is maximized. However, there is no upper bound for \\( a \\) in the problem, so we consider the limit as \\( a \\) approaches infinity. In this case, \\( \\sqrt{a^2 + 6} \\) also approaches infinity, but we need to find the maximum finite value.\n\nBy analyzing the quadratic equation, we see that the maximum value of \\( k \\) occurs when \\( a = 1 \\):\n\\[ k = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{1^2 + 6}}{2} = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{7}}{2}. \\]\n\nThus, the maximum possible value of \\( k \\) is:\n\\[ k = \\frac{\\sqrt{7} - 1}{2}. \\]\n</think>\n<answer>\n\\[ k = \\frac{\\sqrt{7} - 1}{2}. \\]\n</answer>"}

By what formula can $f(n)$ be represented for any natural $n$? How does the situation stand for fractional values of $n$?\nassistant\n<think>\nTo determine the formula for $f(n)$, we need to understand the properties of the function given that the second difference is constant. The second difference being constant implies that the function is a quadratic function. A quadratic function can be represented in the form $f(n) = an^2 + bn + c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants.\n\nFor natural values of $n$, the situation is straightforward. We can use the given table of values to solve for $a$, $b$, and $c$.\n\nFor fractional values of $n$, the situation is more complex. Quadratic functions are not defined for fractional values of $n$ because they involve squaring the input, which is not defined for non-integer values. Therefore, we cannot represent $f(n)$ as a quadratic function for fractional values of $n$.\n</think>\n<answer>\nFor natural values of $n$, the function $f(n)$ can be represented as a quadratic function of the form $f(n) = an^2 + bn + c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants that can be determined using the given table of values.\n\nFor fractional values of $n$, the situation is more complex.

The cosine function $y=\\cos 10 \\pi x$ oscillates between -1 and 1, and it completes one full cycle every $\\frac{1}{5}$ units.\n\nGiven these properties, we can deduce that the parabola and the cosine function will intersect at most twice within one period of the cosine function.
