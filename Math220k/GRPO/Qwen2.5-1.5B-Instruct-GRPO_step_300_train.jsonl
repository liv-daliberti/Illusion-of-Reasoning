Find the angles of the triangle.\nassistant\n<think>\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the altitudes and the sides of a triangle. The key insight is that if two altitudes are not smaller than the sides on which they are dropped, it implies that the triangle is isosceles. This is because in an isosceles triangle, the altitude from the vertex angle to the base is equal to the length of the base, and the altitude from the base angles to the opposite sides are equal to the lengths of the legs of the triangle.\n\nGiven that two altitudes are not smaller than the sides on which they are dropped, it means that the triangle must be isosceles with two equal sides. This implies that the angles opposite these equal sides must also be equal.\n\nLet's denote the angles of the triangle as \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\). Since the triangle is isosceles, we have two possible cases:\n1. \\(A = B\\)\n2. \\(A = C\\) or \\(B = C\\)\n\nHowever, since the triangle is isosceles, the angles opposite the equal sides must be equal. Therefore, the only possible configuration is \\(A = B\\).\n\nNow, we know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is \\(180^\\circ\\). So, we have:\n\\[A + B + C = 180^\\circ\\]\nSince \\(A = B\\), we can substitute \\(B\\) with \\(A\\):\n\\[A + A + C = 180^\\circ\\]\n\\[2A + C = 180^\\circ\\]\n\nSince \\(A = B\\) and the triangle is isosceles, the angles must be such that the sum of the angles is \\(180^\\circ\\). The only way to satisfy this condition with two equal angles is if one of the angles is \\(60^\\circ\\) and the other is \\(120^\\circ\\).

The equation becomes:\n\\[ f(1 + f(y)) = f(1) + y. \\]\n\nThis tells us that \\( f \\) is surjective because for any \\( y \\in \\mathbf{N}^{*} \\), there exists some \\( z = 1 + f(y) \\) such that \\( f(z) = f(1) + y \\). Therefore, \\( f \\) maps every natural number to a natural number.\n\nNext, let's consider the case when \\( y = 1 \\). The equation becomes:\n\\[ f(x + f(1)) = f(x) + 1. \\]\n\nThis implies that \\( f \\) is injective because if \\( f(a) = f(b) \\), then \\( f(a + f(1)) = f(b + f(1)) \\), which would imply \\( f(x) = f(x) + 1 \\), a contradiction. Therefore, \\( f \\) is injective.\n\nSince \\( f \\) is both surjective and injective, it is bijective. Let's denote \\( f(1) = c \\). Then the equation becomes:\n\\[ f(x + c) = f(x) + 1. \\]\n\nThis suggests that \\( f \\) is a linear function. Let's assume \\( f(x) = kx + d \\) for some constants \\( k \\) and \\( d \\). Substituting this into the original equation, we get:\n\\[ f(x + f(y)) = f(x + ky + d) = k(x + ky + d) + d = kx + k^2y + kd + d. \\]\nOn the other hand, we have:\n\\[ f(x) + y = kx + d + y. \\]\nEquating the two expressions, we get:\n\\[ kx + k^2y + kd + d = kx + y + d. \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ k^2y = y. \\]\nSince \\( y \\neq 0 \\), we must have \\( k^2 = 1 \\), so \\( k = 1 \\) or \\( k = -1 \\).\n\nIf \\( k = 1 \\), then \\( f(x) = x + d \\). Substituting back, we get:\n\\[ f(x + f(y)) = f(x + y + d) = x + y + 2d, \\]\nand\n\\[ f(x) + y = x + d + y. \\]\nEquating these, we get:\n\\[ x + y + 2d = x + y + d, \\]\nwhich simplifies to \\( d = 0 \\). Therefore, \\( f(x) = x \\) is a solution.\n\nIf \\( k = -1 \\), then \\( f(x) = -x + d \\). Substituting back, we get:\n\\[ f(x + f(y)) = f(x - y + d) = -x + y + d, \\]\nand\n\\[ f(x) + y = -x + d + y. \\]\nEquating these, we get:\n\\[ -x + y + d = -x + y + d, \\]\nwhich simplifies to \\( d = 0 \\).

Find the ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the pyramid, if the lateral edge of the pyramid makes an angle $\\alpha$ with the base plane.\nassistant\n<think>\nTo find the ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the pyramid, we need to consider the geometric properties of the pyramid and the cube. Let's start by understanding the relationship between the cube and the pyramid.\n\nGiven that the cube is inscribed in the pyramid, the vertices of the cube's upper base lie on the lateral edges of the pyramid, and the vertices of the cube's lower base are in the plane of the pyramid's base. This configuration implies that the cube is oriented such that its edges are parallel to the edges of the pyramid.\n\nThe lateral edge of the pyramid makes an angle $\\alpha$ with the base plane. This angle helps us determine the height of the pyramid and the side length of the cube.\n\nLet's denote the side length of the cube as $s$ and the height of the pyramid as $h$. The lateral edge of the pyramid is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with one leg being the height of the pyramid and the other leg being the distance from the center of the base to the midpoint of one of the lateral edges.\n\nThe distance from the center of the base to the midpoint of one of the lateral edges is $\\frac{h}{2} \\cot \\alpha$. The height of the pyramid can be expressed as $h = s \\cot \\alpha$ because the cube's side length $s$ is parallel to the lateral edges and the angle between the lateral edge and the base is $\\alpha$.\n\nThe volume of the cube is $V_{\\text{cube}} = s^3$ and the volume of the pyramid is $V_{\\text{pyramid}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{Base Area} \\times \\text{Height} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times s^2 \\times h = \\frac{1}{3} \\times s^2 \\times s \\cot \\alpha = \\frac{1}{3} s^3 \\cot \\alpha$.\n\nThe ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the pyramid is:\n\\[\n\\frac{V_{\\text{cube}}}{V_{\\text{pyramid}}} = \\frac{s^3}{\\frac{1}{3} s^3 \\cot \\alpha} = \\frac{3}{\\cot \\alpha} = 3 \\tan \\alpha\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the pyramid is $3 \\tan \\alpha$.\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the pyramid is $3 \\tan \\alpha$.\n</answer>", "300_correct": false, "300_changed": false}

Subtracting 1 changes the parity, while adding 1 preserves the parity.\n\n7. **Parity of the Sum:**\n   - The initial sum modulo 2013 is even (since 2013 is odd, and the sum of an odd number of odd numbers is odd, and the sum of an even number of odd numbers is even).\n   - Each operation changes the parity of the sum. Therefore, the parity of the sum will alternate between even and odd with each operation.\n\n8. **Achieving the Target:**\n   - To have all entries divisible by 2013, the sum of the entire array modulo 2013 must be 0.\n   - Since the initial sum is even, and the parity of the sum alternates, it is impossible to reach an even sum (0 modulo 2013) by alternating between even and odd sums.\n\n9. **Conclusion:**\n   - It is impossible to get an array where all integers are divisible by 2013 using the given operations.\n\nTherefore, the number of arrays that can achieve this is 0.\n</think>\n<answer>\n0\n</answer>", "300_correct": false, "300_changed": false}

Specifically, we need to use the fact that the derivative of a polynomial can have at most as many roots as the polynomial itself, but with a different multiplicity.\n\nGiven that $P(x^2)$ has $2n+1$ roots, we need to determine the smallest number of roots that $P(x)$ can have. Let's denote the roots of $P(x)$ by $r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_m$. When we substitute $x^2$ for $x$ in $P(x)$, we get $P(x^2)$. The roots of $P(x^2)$ are the values of $x$ such that $x^2 = r_i$ for each root $r_i$ of $P(x)$. This means that each root $r_i$ of $P(x)$ corresponds to two roots of $P(x^2)$, except for the case where $r_i = 0$ (since $0^2 = 0$ and $0$ is a root of $P(x^2)$).\n\nTherefore, if $P(x)$ has $m$ roots, $P(x^2)$ will have $", "300_correct": false, "300_changed": false}

Let's denote the amount of the $15\\%$ alcohol solution as $x$ gallons. Consequently, the amount of the $35\\%$ alcohol solution will be $250 - x$ gallons.\n\nThe total amount of alcohol in the $15\\%$ solution is $0.15x$ gallons, and the total amount of alcohol in the $35\\%$ solution is $0.35(250 - x)$ gallons. The final solution is $250$ gallons with a $21\\%$ alcohol content, so the total amount of alcohol in the final solution is $0.21 \\times 250$ gallons.\n\nWe can set up the equation as follows:\n\\[0.15x + 0.35(250 - x) = 0.21 \\times 250\\]\n\nNow, let's solve this equation.\n</think>\n<answer>\n\\[0.15x + 0.35(250 - x) = 0.21 \\times 250\\]\n\\[0.15x + 87.5 - 0.35x = 52.5\\]\n\\[-0.20x = -35\\]\n\\[x = 175\\]\n\nSo, we need to mix $175$ gallons of the $15\\%$ alcohol solution with $250 - 175 = 75$ gallons of the $35\\%$ alcohol solution to make $250$ gallons of a $21\\%$ alcohol solution.\n</answer>", "300_correct": true, "300_changed": true}

Let's start by examining the conditions more closely.\n\n1. $a_1 = 2021^{2021}$\n2. $0 \\le a_k < k$ for all integers $k \\ge 2$\n3. $a_1 - a_2 + a_3 - a_4 + \\cdots + (-1)^{k+1}a_k$ is a multiple of $k$ for all positive integers $k$.\n\nThe third condition suggests that the sequence alternates in a specific way. Let's denote the sum of the first $k$ terms as $S_k = a_1 - a_2 + a_3 - a_4 + \\cdots + (-1)^{k+1}a_k$. We know that $S_k$ is a multiple of $k$ for all $k$.\n\nTo find $a_{2021^{2022}}$, we need to understand the pattern of the sequence. Let's consider the first few terms to identify any patterns.\n\nFor $k=1$, we have $S_1 = a_1 = 2021^{2021}$, which is a multiple of 1.\n\nFor $k=2$, we have $S_2 = a_1 - a_2 = 2021^{2021} - a_2$. Since $0 \\le a_2 < 2$, $a_2$ can be 0 or 1. If $a_2 = 0$, then $S_2 = 2021^{2021}$, which is a multiple of 2. If $a_2 = 1$, then $S_2 = 2021^{2021} - 1$, which is not a multiple of 2. Therefore, $a_2$ must be 0.\n\nFor $k=3$, we have $S_3 = a_1 - a_2 + a_3 = 2021^{2021} - 1 + a_3$. Since $0 \\le a_3 < 3$, $a_3$ can be 0, 1, or 2. If $a_3 = 0$, then $S_3 = 2021^{2021}$, which is a multiple of 3. If $a_3 = 1$, then $S_3 = 2021^{2021} - 1 + 1 = 2021^{2021}$, which is a multiple of 3. If $a_3 = 2$, then $S_3 = 2021^{2021} - 1 + 2 = 2021^{2021} + 1$, which is not a multiple of 3. Therefore, $a_3$ must be 1.\n\nWe can see that the sequence alternates between 0 and 1. Specifically, $a_1 = 2021^{2021}$, $a_2 = 0$, $a_3 = 1$, $a_4 = 0$, $a_5 = 1$, and so on. This pattern continues, with every two terms being 0 and 1.\n\nTo find $a_{2021^{2022}}$, we need to determine the position of $2021^{2022}$ in the sequence. Since the sequence alternates every two terms, $2021^{2022}$ will be the $2021^{2022} \\mod 2 = 1$ term in the sequence. Therefore, $a_{2021^{2022}} = 1$.\n\nThus, the $2021^{2022}$th term of the sequence is 1.\n</think>\n<answer>\n1\n</answer>", "300_correct": false, "300_changed": false}

Since \\(p, q, r\\) are primes, they can either be odd or even. If any of them were even, the product \\((p+1)(q+2)(r+3)\\) would be even, but the right-hand side \\(4pqr\\) is even, so this would imply that at least one of \\(p, q, r\\) is even, which is not possible since all primes are odd. Therefore, all three primes must be odd.\n\nNext, let's consider the equation modulo 3. Since all primes are either 1 or 2 modulo 3, we have:\n- If \\(p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\\), then \\(p+1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}\\).\n- If \\(p \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}\\), then \\(p+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}\\).\n\nSimilarly, for \\(q\\) and \\(r\\):\n- If \\(q \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\\), then \\(q+2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}\\).\n- If \\(q \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}\\), then \\(q+2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\\).\n- If \\(r \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\\), then \\(r+3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}\\).\n- If \\(r \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}\\), then \\(r+3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\\).\n\nNow, let's test some small odd primes to see if we can find a solution.

Find all possible values for angle BCQ such that RST is equilateral.\nassistant\n<think>\nTo solve this problem, we need to analyze the geometric properties of the equilateral triangle and the orthocenters. Let's start by understanding the configuration and the properties of the orthocenters.\n\n1. **Equilateral Triangle Properties**: Since ABC is an equilateral triangle, all its internal angles are 60 degrees. The orthocenter of an equilateral triangle is also its centroid, circumcenter, and incenter, which means it is the same point.\n\n2. **Orthocenters R and S**: The orthocenter of a triangle is the point where the altitudes intersect. For an equilateral triangle, the orthocenter, circumcenter, and centroid coincide at the same point, which is the center of the triangle.\n\n3. **Lines BP and CQ**: These lines intersect at point T. We need to find the angle BCQ such that the triangle RST is equilateral.\n\n4. **Angle BCQ**: Since R and S are the same point (the orthocenter), the triangle RST is essentially a triangle formed by the intersection of the altitudes of the equilateral triangle ABC. The key is to find the angle BCQ such that the triangle RST is equilateral.\n\n5. **Possible Values for Angle BCQ**: For RST to be equilateral, the angle BCQ must be such that the triangle formed by the intersection of the altitudes is equilateral. This happens when angle BCQ is 60 degrees. This is because in an equilateral triangle, the angle between the altitudes from two vertices is 60 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the only possible value for angle BCQ such that RST is equilateral is 60 degrees.\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe only possible value for angle BCQ such that RST is equilateral is 60 degrees.\n</answer>", "300_correct": false, "300_changed": false}

When a point is symmetric to another point with respect to the x-axis, their x-coordinates remain the same, but their y-coordinates are negatives of each other. Similarly, when a point is symmetric to another point with respect to the y-axis, their y-coordinates remain the same, but their x-coordinates are negatives of each other.\n\nGiven point $P_{1}(3, a)$ is symmetric to point $P_{2}(b, -2)$ with respect to the x-axis, we can deduce that:\n- The x-coordinate of $P_{1}$ is the same as the x-coordinate of $P_{2}$, so $3 = b$.\n- The y-coordinate of $P_{1}$ is the negative of the y-coordinate of $P_{2}$, so $a = -(-2) = 2$.\n\nNow, to find the coordinates of the point $P_{1}$ symmetric to the y-axis, we change the sign of the x-coordinate while keeping the y-coordinate the same. So, the symmetric point to $P_{1}(3, 2)$ with respect to the y-axis is $P_{3}(3, 2)$.\n\nTo find the coordinates of the point $P_{1}$ symmetric to the origin, we change the signs of both the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate.
