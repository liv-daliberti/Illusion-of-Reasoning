Let's start by examining the sequence and its initial conditions.\n\nThe sequence is defined as follows:\n- $a_1 = 1$\n- $a_{2n} = a_n$\n- $a_{2n+1} = a_n + 1$\n\nWe need to find all positive integers $n$ such that $a_{kn} = a_n$ for all integers $1 \\leq k \\leq n$.\n\nTo approach this, let's consider the properties of the sequence and how it behaves under different values of $k$.\n\nFirst, let's look at the case when $k = 1$:\n- $a_{n \\cdot 1} = a_n$\n\nThis is true by definition, so $n$ can be any positive integer.\n\nNext, let's consider the case when $k = 2$:\n- $a_{n \\cdot 2} = a_n$\n\nThis is also true by definition, so $n$ can be any positive integer.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when $k = 3$:\n- $a_{n \\cdot 3} = a_n + 1$\n\nThis is not necessarily true for all $n$. For example, if $n = 1$, then $a_3 = a_1 + 1 = 2$, but $a_{3 \\cdot 1} = a_3 = 2$. However, if $n = 2$, then $a_6 = a_3 = 2$, but $a_{3 \\cdot 2} = a_6 = 2$. So, $n$ can be any positive integer.\n\nWe can generalize this pattern. For any $k$, $a_{kn} = a_n$ if and only if $n$ is a power of 2. This is because the sequence alternates between $a_n$ and $a_n + 1$ based on whether $n$ is even or odd, and the powers of 2 are the only numbers that will keep the sequence consistent.\n\nTherefore, the positive integers $n$ such that $a_{kn} = a_n$ for all integers $1 \\leq k \\leq n$ are the powers of 2.\n\nb) To prove that there exist infinitely many positive integers $m$ such that $a_{km} \\geq a_m$ for all positive integers $k$, we need to consider the behavior of the sequence.\n\nFrom part (a), we know that $a_{kn} = a_n$ if and only if $n$ is a power of 2. This means that for any power of 2, $a_{kn} = a_n$.\n\nNow, let's consider the sequence for any positive integer $m$. If $m$ is not a power of 2, then $a_m$ will be less than $a_{kn}$ for some $k$ that is not a power of 2. This is because the sequence alternates between $a_n$ and $a_n + 1$ based on whether $n$ is even or odd.\n\nTherefore, there exist infinitely many positive integers $m$ such that $a_{km} \\geq a_m$ for all positive integers $k$.\n\nIn conclusion, the positive integers $n$ such that $a_{kn} = a_n$ for all integers $1 \\leq k \\leq n$ are the powers of 2, and there exist infinitely many positive integers $m$ such that $a_{km} \\geq a_m$ for all positive integers $k$.\n</think>\n<answer>\na) The positive integers $n$ such that $a_{kn} = a_n$ for all integers $1 \\leq k \\leq n$ are the powers of 2.\n\nb) There exist infinitely many positive integers $m$ such that $a_{km} \\geq a_m$ for all positive integers $k$.\n</answer>", "750_correct": false, "750_changed": false}

After the ball has traveled a cumulative distance of $30\\sqrt{2}$, compute its distance from the origin.\nassistant\n<think>\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand the path of the point as it bounces inside the equilateral triangle. The key is to recognize that the point's path can be broken down into a series of straight-line segments, each of which is a reflection of the original path across an edge of the triangle.\n\nGiven that the point starts at the origin and moves in the direction of $(1,1)$, we can represent this direction vector as $(1,1)$. The cumulative distance traveled is $30\\sqrt{2}$, which is the length of the vector $(1,1)$ scaled by some factor. This factor is the number of times the point has traveled the length of $(1,1)$.\n\nThe length of the vector $(1,1)$ is $\\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, the point has traveled $\\frac{30\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}} = 30$ times the length of $(1,1)$.\n\nSince the point bounces elastically off the edges of the triangle, each bounce changes the direction of the vector by $90^\\circ$.

Each bounce changes the direction of the vector by $90^\\circ$, and after an even number of bounces, the net displacement will be in the same direction as the original vector, and after an odd number of bounces, the net displacement will be in the opposite direction.\n\nSince 30 is an even number, the net displacement after 30 bounces will be in the same direction as the original vector $(1,1)$. The distance from the origin to the point after 30 bounces is the magnitude of the vector $(1,1)$, which is $\\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{2}$.\n\nTherefore, the distance from the origin after the point has traveled a cumulative distance of $30\\sqrt{2}$ is $\\sqrt{2}$.\n</think>\n<answer>\n$\\sqrt{2}$\n</answer>", "750_correct": false, "750_changed": false}

Find the area of the part of the triangle that is outside these circles.\nassistant\n<think>\nTo find the area of the part of the triangle that is outside the circles, we need to first determine the radius of the circles and then calculate the area of the triangle and the circles.\n</think>\n<answer>\nLet's start by finding the radius of the circles. Since the circles touch two sides of the triangle and two other circles, we can see that the radius of each circle is equal to the height of the equilateral triangle divided by 3. This is because the height of an equilateral triangle is equal to the side length multiplied by the square root of 3, and the radius of each circle is half of that height.\nThe height of the equilateral triangle is given by the formula: height = side * sqrt(3) / 2. So, the radius of each circle is: radius = (side * sqrt(3) / 2) / 3 = side * sqrt(3) / 6.\nNow, let's calculate the area of the triangle and the circles. The area of the equilateral triangle is given by the formula: area = (side^2 * sqrt(3)) / 4. The area of each circle is given by the formula: area = pi * radius^2. Since there are three circles, the total area of the circles is: total_area = 3 * pi * radius^2 = 3 * pi * (side * sqrt(3) / 6)^2 = pi * side^2.\nFinally, the area of the part of the triangle that is outside the circles is given by the formula: area = area of triangle - total_area = (side^2 * sqrt(3)) / 4 - pi * side^2.\n</answer>", "750_correct": false, "750_changed": false}

Let's also denote the number of mushrooms each child has as \\( m \\).\n\nFrom the problem, we know that if Anya gives half of her mushrooms to Vitya, all the children will have the same number of mushrooms. This means that after giving half of her mushrooms to Vitya, Anya will have \\( \\frac{A}{2} \\) mushrooms left, and each child will have \\( m + \\frac{A}{2n} \\) mushrooms. Since this is the same for all children, we can write:\n\\[ m + \\frac{A}{2n} = m \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ \\frac{A}{2n} = 0 \\]\nThis implies that \\( A = 0 \\), which is not possible since Anya has mushrooms. Instead, we need to consider the second condition, where Anya gives all her mushrooms to Sasha, and Sasha will have as many mushrooms as all the others combined. This means that after giving all her mushrooms to Sasha, Anya will have \\( A - m \\) mushrooms left, and Sasha will have \\( A \\) mushrooms.

Let's start by understanding the geometry of the problem.\n\nThe ellipse is given by the equation \\(\\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1\\), with \\(a > b > 0\\). The endpoints of the major axis are \\(A(a, 0)\\) and \\(A_1(-a, 0)\\).

The coordinates of \\(P\\) can be expressed in terms of the parameters of the ellipse and the line segment. By symmetry and the properties of the ellipse, we can deduce that the point \\(P\\) lies on the line \\(x = 0\\).\n\nTo confirm this, we can use the fact that the point \\(P\\) is the intersection of the lines \\(AC\\) and \\(A_1D\\). Since \\(A\\) and \\(A_1\\) are symmetric with respect to the x-axis, and the ellipse is symmetric, the point \\(P\\) must lie on the x-axis.

If the function is not defined or not continuous at that value, we need to use other methods such as L'Hôpital's rule or algebraic manipulation.\n\nFor the first function, $f(x) = x^3 - 5x^2 + 2x + 4$, we can directly substitute $x = -3$ into the function because it is a polynomial and is continuous everywhere. Let's calculate it:\n\n$f(-3) = (-3)^3 - 5(-3)^2 + 2(-3) + 4 = -27 - 45 - 6 + 4 = -74$\n\nSo, the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $-3$ is $-74$.\n\nFor the second function, $\\varphi(t) = t\\sqrt{t^2 - 20} - \\lg(t + \\sqrt{t^2 - 20})$, we need to be careful because the logarithm function is only defined for positive arguments. As $t$ approaches $6$, the argument of the logarithm, $t + \\sqrt{t^2 - 20}$, approaches $12$, which is positive. However, the square root term $\\sqrt{t^2 - 20}$ approaches $\\sqrt{36 - 20} = \\sqrt{16} = 4$, which is also positive. Therefore, the function is defined at $t = 6$ and the limit as $t$ approaches $6$ is simply the value of the function at $t = 6$.\n\nLet's calculate it:\n\n$\\varphi(6) = 6\\sqrt{6^2 - 20} - \\lg(6 + \\sqrt{6", "750_correct": false, "750_changed": true}

Each segment connects two lattice points that are 1 unit apart, and we need to sum the lengths of all such segments.\n\nFirst, let's consider the structure of the grid. The grid is $10 \\times 10$, which means it has 11 rows and 11 columns of lattice points. Each row and each column contains 11 points.\n\nFor each row, the segments are horizontal and vertical. The number of horizontal segments in a row is 10 (since there are 10 other points to connect to the right), and the number of vertical segments is also 10 (since there are 10 other points to connect to the bottom).

A cube is inscribed in a regular quadrilateral pyramid; the vertices of its upper base lie on the lateral edges, and the vertices of its lower base are in the plane of the pyramid's base. Find the ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the pyramid, if the lateral edge of the pyramid makes an angle $\\alpha$ with the base plane.\nassistant\n<think>\nTo find the ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the pyramid, we need to consider the geometric properties of the pyramid and the cube. Let's start by understanding the relationship between the cube and the pyramid.\n\nGiven that the cube is inscribed in the pyramid, the vertices of the cube's upper base lie on the lateral edges of the pyramid, and the vertices of the cube's lower base are in the plane of the pyramid's base. This configuration implies that the cube is oriented such that its edges are parallel to the edges of the pyramid.\n\nThe key to solving this problem is to determine the relationship between the side length of the cube and the dimensions of the pyramid. Let's denote the side length of the cube as \\( s \\) and the height of the pyramid as \\( h \\).\n\nThe lateral edge of the pyramid makes an angle \\( \\alpha \\) with the base plane. This angle helps us to relate the height of the pyramid to the side length of the cube. The lateral edge of the pyramid can be considered as the hypotenuse of a right triangle where one leg is the height of the pyramid and the other leg is the distance from the center of the base to the midpoint of one of the lateral edges.\n\nThe distance from the center of the base to the midpoint of one of the lateral edges is half the length of the diagonal of the base of the pyramid. Since the base of the pyramid is a square, the diagonal of the base is \\( s\\sqrt{2} \\), and half of this is \\( \\frac{s\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{2}} \\).\n\nNow, we can use the angle \\( \\alpha \\) to find the height of the pyramid. The lateral edge of the pyramid forms a right triangle with the height of the pyramid and the distance from the center of the base to the midpoint of one of the lateral edges. The lateral edge can be considered as the hypotenuse of this right triangle, and the height of the pyramid is the opposite side to the angle \\( \\alpha \\).\n\nUsing the cosine of the angle \\( \\alpha \\), we have:\n\\[ \\cos \\alpha = \\frac{\\text{adjacent}}{\\text{hypotenuse}} = \\frac{\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{2}}}{h} \\]\n\\[ h = \\frac{s}{\\cos \\alpha} \\]\n\nThe volume of the pyramid is given by:\n\\[ V_{\\text{pyramid}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{Base Area} \\times \\text{Height} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times s^2 \\times h = \\frac{1}{3} \\times s^2 \\times \\frac{s}{\\cos \\alpha} = \\frac{s^3}{3 \\cos \\alpha} \\]\n\nThe volume of the cube is:\n\\[ V_{\\text{cube}} = s^3 \\]\n\nThe ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the pyramid is:\n\\[ \\frac{V_{\\text{cube}}}{", "750_correct": false, "750_changed": true}

Then the expression becomes:\n\\[ 1 \\sqrt[3]{9} + 1 \\sqrt[3]{3} + 0 = \\sqrt[3]{9} + \\sqrt[3]{3} \\]\n\nNow, we need to check if this expression can simplify the division. We can use the identity:\n\\[ 12 \\sqrt[3]{9} + 52 \\sqrt[3]{3} + 49 = 12 (\\sqrt[3]{9} + \\sqrt[3]{3}) + 49 \\]\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\\[ 529 = 12 (\\sqrt[3]{9} + \\sqrt[3]{3}) + 49 \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ 529 - 49 = 12 (\\sqrt[3]{9} + \\sqrt[3]{3}) \\]\n\\[ 480 = 12 (\\sqrt[3]{9} + \\sqrt[3]{3}) \\]\n\\[ 40 = \\sqrt[3]{9} + \\sqrt[3]{3} \\]\n\nThis is a known result, so we can use it to simplify the division.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Operations:**\n   - Operation 1: Subtract 1 from each entry in a chosen row.\n   - Operation 2: Add 1 to each entry in a chosen column.\n\n2. **Modulo Operation:**\n   - We are working modulo 2013, so any number \\( n \\) can be reduced to \\( n \\mod 2013 \\).\n\n3. **Effect of Operations on Modulo:**\n   - Subtracting 1 from each entry in a row will reduce the value of each entry by 1 modulo 2013.\n   - Adding 1 to each entry in a column will increase the value of each entry by 1 modulo 2013.\n\n4. **Initial Array:**\n   - The initial array has entries between 1 and 2013, inclusive.\n\n5. **Target Array:**\n   - We want all entries to be divisible by 2013.\n\n6. **Parity Consideration:**\n   - Subtracting 1 from each entry in a row will change the parity (odd/even nature) of each entry.\n   - Adding 1 to each entry in a column will change the parity of each entry.\n\n7. **Parity of the Array:**\n   - The parity of the array will change with each operation.\n   - To get all entries divisible by 2013, we need to ensure that the parity of each entry is such that it can be divided by 2013.\n\n8. **Counting Valid Arrays:**\n   - For each row, we can choose to subtract 1 or not, and for each column, we can choose to add 1 or not.\n   - This gives us \\( 2^{2013} \\) choices for the rows and \\( 2^{2013} \\) choices for the columns.\n   - However, we need to ensure that the parity of the array is such that it can be divided by 2013.\n\n9. **Conclusion:**\n   - The number of valid arrays is \\( 2^{2013} \\times 2^{2013} = 2^{4026} \\).\n\nTherefore, the number of arrays where all integers are divisible by 2013 is \\( 2^{4026} \\).\n\n</think>\n<answer>\n\\[ 2^{4026} \\]\n</answer>", "750_correct": false, "750_changed": false}

Specifically, we need to use the fact that the derivative of a polynomial can have at most as many roots as the polynomial itself, but with a different multiplicity.\n\nGiven that \\( P(x^2) \\) has \\( 2n + 1 \\) roots, we need to determine the smallest number of roots that \\( P(x) \\) can have. Let's denote the roots of \\( P(x) \\) by \\( r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_m \\). Then, the roots of \\( P(x^2) \\) are \\( r_1^2, r_2^2, \\ldots, r_m^2 \\).\n\nSince \\( P(x^2) \\) has \\( 2n + 1 \\) roots, the number of distinct roots of \\( P(x^2) \\) is \\( 2n + 1 \\).
