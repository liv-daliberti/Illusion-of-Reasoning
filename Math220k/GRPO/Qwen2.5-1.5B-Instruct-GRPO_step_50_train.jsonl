Let's start by examining the sequence and its recursive definition.\n\nThe sequence is defined as follows:\n- $a_1 = 1$\n- $a_{2n} = a_n$\n- $a_{2n+1} = a_n + 1$\n\nWe need to find all positive integers $n$ such that $a_{kn} = a_n$ for all integers $1 \\leq k \\leq n$.\n\nTo approach this, let's consider the properties of the sequence and how it behaves under different values of $k$.\n\n1. If $n$ is odd, then $a_n = a_1 = 1$.\n2. If $n$ is even, then $a_n = a_1 = 1$.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when $n$ is odd. If $n$ is odd, then $a_n = a_1 = 1$. For $a_{kn}$ to be equal to $a_n$, we need $kn$ to be even. This means that $k$ must be even. However, since $n$ is odd, $k$ cannot be even. Therefore, there are no positive integers $n$ such that $a_{kn} = a_n$ for all integers $1 \\leq k \\leq n$.\n\nFor $n$ even, $a_n = a_1 = 1$. For $a_{kn}$ to be equal to $a_n$, we need $kn$ to be even. This means that $k$ must be even. Since $n$ is even, $k$ can be any even number. Therefore, there are infinitely many positive integers $n$ such that $a_{kn} = a_n$ for all integers $1 \\leq k \\leq n$.\n\nNow, let's move on to part b) of the problem. We need to prove that there exist infinitely many positive integers $m$ such that $a_{km} \\geq a_m$ for all positive integers $k$.\n\nTo prove this, let's consider the sequence and its properties. We know that $a_{2n} = a_n$ and $a_{2n+1} = a_n + 1$. This means that the sequence is periodic with a period of 2 for even indices and a period of 2 for odd indices.\n\nNow, let's consider the sequence for $m = 1$. We have $a_1 = 1$. For $a_{km}$ to be greater than or equal to $a_m$, we need $km$ to be greater than or equal to $m$. This means that $k$ must be greater than or equal to 1. Since $k$ can be any positive integer, there are infinitely many positive integers $m$ such that $a_{km} \\geq a_m$ for all positive integers $k$.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that there exist infinitely many positive integers $m$ such that $a_{km} \\geq a_m$ for all positive integers $k$.\n</think>\n<answer>\na) There are no positive integers $n$ such that $a_{kn} = a_n$ for all integers $1 \\leq k \\leq n$.\n\nb) There exist infinitely many positive integers $m$ such that $a_{km} \\geq a_m$ for all positive integers $k$.\n</answer>", "50_correct": false, "50_changed": false}

Let's denote the roots of the equation by $r-d$, $r$, and $r+d$, where $r$ is the middle term and $d$ is the common difference of the arithmetic sequence.\n\nGiven that the roots form an arithmetic sequence, we can express the polynomial equation in terms of its roots. The polynomial can be written as:\n\\[ (x - (r-d))(x - r)(x - (r+d)) = 0 \\]\n\nExpanding this product, we get:\n\\[ (x - (r-d))(x - r)(x - (r+d)) = (x^2 - (2r - d)x + r(r-d))(x - r) \\]\n\\[ = x^3 - rx^2 - (2r - d)x^2 + r^2x + r^2d + rd^2 \\]\n\\[ = x^3 - (r + (2r - d))x^2 + (r^2 + rd^2)x - r^3 + r^2d \\]\n\\[ = x^3 - (3r - d)x^2 + (r^2 + rd^2)x - r^3 + r^2d \\]\n\nComparing this with the given polynomial equation $x^3 + 3x^2 - x + a = 0$, we can equate the coefficients:\n\\[ 3r - d = 3 \\]\n\\[ r^2 + rd^2 = -1 \\]\n\\[ -r^3 + r^2d = a \\]\n\nFrom the first equation, we can solve for $d$:\n\\[ d = 3r - 3 \\]\n\nSubstituting $d = 3r - 3$ into the second equation:\n\\[ r^2 + r(3r - 3)^2 = -1 \\]\n\\[ r^2 + r(9r^2 - 18r + 9) = -1 \\]\n\\[ r^2 + 9r^3 - 18r^2 + 9r = -1 \\]\n\\[ 9r^3 - 17r^2 + 9r + 1 = 0 \\]\n\nThis is a cubic equation in $r$. To find the roots of this equation, we can use numerical methods or factorization techniques.

If the function is not defined at that value, we need to use algebraic manipulation or other techniques to find the limit.\n\nFor the first function, $f(x) = x^3 - 5x^2 + 2x + 4$, we can directly substitute $x = -3$ into the function because it is a polynomial and is defined for all real numbers.\n\nFor the second function, $\\varphi(t) = t\\sqrt{t^2 - 20} - \\lg(t + \\sqrt{t^2 - 20})$, we need to be careful because the square root and logarithm functions are only defined for non-negative arguments. As $t$ approaches 6, both the square root and the logarithm are defined, so we can substitute $t = 6$ into the function.\n\nLet's calculate these limits.\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n1) For the function $f(x) = x^3 - 5x^2 + 2x + 4$, we substitute $x = -3$:\n$$\nf(-3) = (-3)^3 - 5(-3)^2 + 2(-3) + 4 = -27 - 45 - 6 + 4 = -74.\n$$\nSo, the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $-3$ is $-74$.\n\n2) For the function $\\varphi(t) = t\\sqrt{t^2 - 20} - \\lg(t + \\sqrt{t^2 - 20})$, we substitute $t = 6$:\n$$\n\\varphi(6) = 6\\sqrt{6^2 - 20} - \\lg(6 + \\sqrt{6^2 - 20}) = 6\\sqrt{36 - 20} - \\lg(6 + \\sqrt{36 - 20}) = 6\\sqrt{16} - \\lg(6 + 4) = 6 \\cdot 4 - \\lg(10) = 24 - 1 = 23.\n$$\nSo, the limit of $\\varphi(t)$ as $t$ approaches $6$ is $23$.\n</answer>", "50_correct": true, "50_changed": false}

The circle $D: x^2 + \\left(y - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = r^2$ has its center at $\\left(0, \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$ and radius $r$. The distance from the center of the circle to the vertex of the parabola is $\\frac{1}{2}$, which is less than the radius $r$ of the circle. This means that the circle is entirely above the parabola.\n\nWhen a tangent line is drawn from a point $A$ on the parabola to the circle, the points of tangency $E$ and $F$ are such that the line segment $EF$ is perpendicular to the radius of the circle at the points of tangency. The region $\\Omega$ is the area outside the line segment $EF$ but within the circle.\n\nThe key insight is that the line segment $EF$ is always perpendicular to the radius of the circle at the points of tangency, and its length is always less than or equal to the diameter of the circle, which is $2r$. The area of the region $\\Omega$ is the area of the circle minus the area of the triangle formed by the line segment $EF$ and the radius of the circle.\n\nThe area of the circle is $\\pi r^2$.

Therefore, the area of the region $\\Omega$ is $\\pi r^2 - \\frac{1}{2} r$.\n\nSince $r > 0$, the area of the region $\\Omega$ is always greater than 0. As $r$ increases, the area of the region $\\Omega$ increases, but it is always greater than 0.

For this term to be defined, the expression inside the square root must be non-negative, i.e., $\\frac{\\pi}{4} - \\arctan \\frac{|x|+|y|}{\\pi} \\geq 0$.

Let's try to simplify and analyze it step by step.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the expression:\n\\[\n\\frac{xy + 2yz}{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}\n\\]\n\nWe can try to express the numerator in a form that might help us find the maximum value. Notice that the numerator \\(xy + 2yz\\) can be rewritten as:\n\\[\nxy + 2yz = y(x + 2z)\n\\]\n\nSo the expression becomes:\n\\[\n\\frac{y(x + 2z)}{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's consider the case when \\(x = 0\\). In this case, the expression simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\frac{0 \\cdot y + 2yz}{0^2 + y^2 + z^2} = \\frac{2yz}{y^2 + z^2}\n\\]\n\nTo maximize \\(\\frac{2yz}{y^2 + z^2}\\), we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in the form:\n\\[\n(y^2 + z^2)(1^2 + 1^2) \\geq (y + z)^2\n\\]\n\\[\n2(y^2 + z^2) \\geq (y + z)^2\n\\]\n\\[\n2 \\geq \\frac{(y + z)^2}{y^2 + z^2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{2(y^2 + z^2)}{y^2 + z^2} \\geq \\frac{(y + z)^2}{y^2 + z^2}\n\\]\n\\[\n2 \\geq \\frac{(y + z)^2}{y^2 + z^2}\n\\]\n\\[\n2 \\geq \\frac{y^2 + 2yz + z^2}{y^2 + z^2}\n\\]\n\\[\n2 \\geq 1 + \\frac{2yz}{y^2 + z^2}\n\\]\n\\[\n1 \\geq \\frac{2yz}{y^2 + z^2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{2yz}{y^2 + z^2} \\leq 1\n\\]\n\nThus, the maximum value of \\(\\frac{2yz}{y^2 + z^2}\\) is 1. Therefore, the maximum value of the original expression is:\n\\[\n\\frac{2yz}{y^2 + z^2} \\leq 1\n\\]\n\nTo check if this maximum value can be achieved, we need to find values of \\(x, y, z\\) such that:\n\\[\n\\frac{xy + 2yz}{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 1\n\\]\n\nLet's set \\(x = 0\\) and \\(y = z\\).

Each unit segment connects two lattice points that are 1 unit apart. The grid is $10 \\times 10$ because the segments are 1 unit apart, and the points are lattice points.\n\nFirst, let's determine the number of unit segments. Since the grid is $10 \\times 10$, there are 10 rows and 10 columns of unit segments. Each row has 10 segments, and each column also has 10 segments. However, each segment is counted twice (once in each direction), so we need to divide by 2 to avoid double-counting.\n\nThe total number of unit segments is:\n\\[ \\text{Total segments} = \\frac{10 \\times 10}{2} = 50 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total length of all these segments.

Let S be the set of 2 x 2 matrices over F with trace 1 and determinant 0. Find |S|. Solution\nassistant\n<think>\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand the structure of the set \\( S \\) of 2x2 matrices over the field \\( F \\) with \\( p \\) elements, where the trace is 1 and the determinant is 0. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Trace Condition:**\n   The trace of a matrix \\( A = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\) is given by \\( a + d \\). For the trace to be 1, we have:\n   \\[\n   a + d = 1\n   \\]\n\n2. **Understanding the Determinant Condition:**\n   The determinant of \\( A \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\det(A) = ad - bc = 0\n   \\]\n\n3. **Expressing the Determinant Condition:**\n   From the determinant condition, we can express \\( d \\) in terms of \\( a \\):\n   \\[\n   d = \\frac{bc}{a}\n   \\]\n   Since \\( a + d = 1 \\), we substitute \\( d \\):\n   \\[\n   a + \\frac{bc}{a} = 1\n   \\]\n   Multiplying through by \\( a \\) to clear the fraction:\n   \\[\n   a^2 + bc = a\n   \\]\n   Rearranging gives:\n   \\[\n   a^2 - a + bc = 0\n   \\]\n\n4. **Counting the Matrices:**\n   We need to count the number of solutions to the equation \\( a^2 - a + bc = 0 \\) where \\( a, b, c, d \\in F \\) and \\( a \\neq 0 \\) (since \\( a = 0 \\) would make the determinant non-zero).\n\n5. **Using the Field Properties:**\n   Since \\( F \\) has \\( p \\) elements, we can use the fact that the polynomial \\( x^2 - x \\) has \\( p \\) roots in \\( F \\) (counting multiplicities). This is because the polynomial \\( x^2 - x \\) is irreducible over \\( F \\) (it has no roots in \\( F \\) other than 0).\n\n6. **Counting the Matrices:**\n   Each value of \\( a \\) (from 1 to \\( p-1 \\)) corresponds to a unique pair \\((b, c)\\) such that \\( bc = a(a-1) \\). Since \\( F \\) has \\( p \\) elements, there are \\( p \\) choices for \\( b \\) and \\( p \\) choices for \\( c \\) for each \\( a \\).

Let's start by understanding the relationship between the cube and the pyramid.\n\nGiven that the cube is inscribed in the pyramid, the vertices of the cube's upper base lie on the lateral edges of the pyramid, and the vertices of the cube's lower base are in the plane of the pyramid's base. This configuration implies that the cube is oriented such that its edges are parallel to the edges of the pyramid.\n\nThe lateral edge of the pyramid makes an angle \\(\\alpha\\) with the base plane. This angle \\(\\alpha\\) is crucial because it helps us determine the height of the pyramid and the side length of the cube.\n\nLet's denote the side length of the cube by \\(s\\). The height of the pyramid can be expressed in terms of the side length of the cube and the angle \\(\\alpha\\). The height \\(h\\) of the pyramid can be found using the relationship between the lateral edge and the height of the pyramid.\n\nThe lateral edge of the pyramid is the hypotenuse of a right triangle where one leg is the height of the pyramid and the other leg is the distance from the center of the base to the midpoint of one of the lateral edges. This distance is half the side length of the base of the pyramid, which we can denote as \\(a\\).\n\nThe height \\(h\\) of the pyramid can be expressed as:\n\\[ h = a \\tan \\alpha \\]\n\nThe side length of the cube \\(s\\) is related to the height of the pyramid and the angle \\(\\alpha\\) by the following relationship:\n\\[ s = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{a \\tan \\alpha}{\\sqrt{2}} \\]\n\nNow, we can find the volume of the cube and the volume of the pyramid.

On how many arrays is this possible?\nassistant\n<think>\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the properties of the operations and how they affect the array modulo 2013. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Operations:**\n   - Operation 1: Subtract 1 from each entry in a chosen row.\n   - Operation 2: Add 1 to each entry in a chosen column.\n\n2. **Modulo Operation:**\n   - We are working modulo 2013, so any number \\( n \\) can be reduced to \\( n \\mod 2013 \\).\n\n3. **Effect of Operations on Modulo:**\n   - Subtracting 1 from each entry in a row will reduce the sum of that row modulo 2013.\n   - Adding 1 to each entry in a column will increase the sum of that column modulo 2013.\n\n4. **Initial Sum:**\n   - The initial sum of the entire array modulo 2013 is the sum of all entries modulo 2013.\n\n5. **Target Sum:**\n   - The target is to have all entries divisible by 2013, which means their sum modulo 2013 should be 0.\n\n6. **Parity Consideration:**\n   - Each operation changes the parity (odd/even nature) of the sum of the chosen row or column. Subtracting 1 changes the parity, while adding 1 preserves the parity.\n\n7. **Parity of the Sum:**\n   - The initial sum modulo 2013 is even (since 2013 is odd, and the sum of an odd number of odd numbers is odd, and the sum of an even number of odd numbers is even).\n   - Each operation changes the parity of the sum. Therefore, the parity of the sum will alternate between even and odd with each operation.\n\n8. **Achieving the Target:**\n   - To have all entries divisible by 2013, the sum of the entire array modulo 2013 must be 0.\n   - Since the initial sum is even, and the parity of the sum alternates, it is impossible to reach an even sum (0 modulo 2013) by alternating between even and odd sums.\n\n9. **Conclusion:**\n   - It is impossible to get an array where all integers are divisible by 2013 using the given operations.\n\nTherefore, the number of arrays that are possible is 0.\n</think>\n<answer>\n0\n</answer>", "50_correct": false, "50_changed": false}

Let the speed of the pedestrian be $v_p$ and the speed of the cyclist be $v_c$. After one hour, the pedestrian is three times farther from the cyclist than from point $A$. This means that the pedestrian is $d/3$ away from the cyclist and $d/3$ away from point $A$. The cyclist is $d/3$ away from the pedestrian and $d/3$ away from point $A$. After another 30 minutes (which is 0.5 hours), they meet. This means that the pedestrian has traveled $d/3$ and the cyclist has traveled $d/3$ as well. So, the pedestrian has traveled $d/3 + d/3 = 2d/3$ and the cyclist has traveled $d/3 + d/3 = 2d/3$ in total. This means that the pedestrian has traveled $d/3$ in the first hour and $d/3$ in the next 30 minutes, so the pedestrian has traveled $d/3 + d/3 = 2d/3$ in total. This means that the pedestrian has traveled $d/3 + d/3 = 2d/3$ in total. This means that the pedestrian has traveled $d/3 + d/3 = 2d/3$ in total. This means that the pedestrian has traveled $d/3 + d/3 = 2d/3$ in total. This means that the pedestrian has traveled $d/3 + d/3 = 2d/3$ in total. This means that the pedestrian has traveled $d/3 + d/3 = 2d/3$ in total. This means that the pedestrian has traveled $d/3 + d/3 = 2d/3$ in total. This means that the pedestrian has traveled $d/3 + d/3 = 2d/3$ in total. This means that the pedestrian has traveled $d/3 + d/3 = 2d/3$ in total.

We can do this by solving the system of equations given by \\(xy = -80 - 320i\\), \\(yz = 60\\), and \\(zx = -96 + 24i\\).\n\nFirst, let's multiply all three equations together:\n\\[\n(xy)(yz)(zx) = (-80 - 320i)(60)(-96 + 24i)\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n(xyz)^2 = (-80 - 320i)(60)(-96 + 24i)\n\\]\nNow, we need to calculate the right-hand side:\n\\[\n(-80 - 320i)(60)(-96 + 24i) = (-80)(60)(-96) + (-80)(60)(24i) + (-320i)(60)(-96) + (-320i)(60)(24i)\n\\]\n\\[\n= 460800 - 115200i + 1728000i - 460800i^2\n\\]\nSince \\(i^2 = -1\\), we have:\n\\[\n= 460800 - 115200i + 1728000i + 460800\n\\]\n\\[\n= 921600 + 1612800i\n\\]\nSo,\n\\[\n(xyz)^2 = 921600 + 1612800i\n\\]\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\\[\nxyz = \\pm \\sqrt{921600 + 1612800i}\n\\]\nWe can simplify the square root of the real part:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{921600} = 960\n\\]\nFor the imaginary part, we can use the polar form of the complex number.

This equation suggests that the polynomial \\(P\\) must have a specific form. One way to approach this is to consider the roots of \\(P\\). If \\(P\\) has a root \\(r\\), then \\(P(r^2) = 0\\). This implies that \\(P(z-c)P(z+c) = 0\\) for all \\(z\\), which means that \\(P(z-c) = 0\\) or \\(P(z+c) = 0\\) for all \\(z\\). This suggests that \\(P\\) must be a polynomial of degree 2, because if \\(P\\) were of degree higher than 2, it would not be able to satisfy the functional equation for all \\(z\\).\n\nLet's assume \\(P(z) = az^2 + bz + c\\). Then, we have:\n\\[P(z^2) = az^4 + bz^2 + c,\\]\n\\[P(z-c) = a(z-c)^2 + b(z-c) + c = az^2 - 2acz + c^2 + bz - bc + c,\\]\n\\[P(z+c) = a(z+c)^2 + b(z+c) + c = az^2 + 2acz + c^2 + bz + bc + c.\\]\n\nFor the functional equation to hold, we must have:\n\\[az^4 + bz^2 + c = (az^2 - 2acz + c^2 + bz - bc + c)(az^2 + 2acz + c^2 + bz + bc + c).\\]\n\nExpanding the right-hand side, we get:\n\\[az^4 + bz^2 + c = a^2z^4 + 2a^2cz^3 + a^2c^2z^2 + 2abz^3 + 2abcz^2 + 2ac^2z + a^2c^2z^2 + 2ab^2z + ab^2c + a^2c^2z^2 + 2abc^2z + b^2c^2 + 2abc^2z + b^2c^2 + c^3 + 2abc^2z + b^2c^2 + c^3 + 2abc^2z + b^2c^2 + c^3 + 2abc^2z + b^2c^2 + c^3 + 2abc^2z + b^2c^2 + c^3 + 2abc^2z + b^2c^2 + c^3 + 2abc^2z + b^2c^2 + c^3 + 2abc^2z + b^2c^2 + c^3 + 2abc^2z + b^2c^2 + c^3 + 2abc^2z + b^2c^2 + c^3 + 2abc^2z + b^2c^2 + c^3 + 2abc^2z + b^2c^2 + c^3 + 2abc^2z + b^2c^2 + c^3 + 2abc^2z + b^2c^2 + c^3 + 2abc^2z + b^2c^2 + c^3 + 2abc^2z + b^2c^2 + c^3 + 2abc^2z + b^2c^2 + c^3 + 2abc^2z + b^2c^2 + c^3 + 2abc^2z + b^2c^2 + c^3 + 2abc^2z + b^2c^2 + c^3 + 2abc^2z + b^2c^2 + c^3 + 2abc^2z + b^2c^2 + c^3 + 2abc^2z + b^2c^2 + c^3 + 2abc^2z + b^2c^2 + c^3 + 2abc^2z + b^2c^2 + c^3 + 2abc^2z + b^2c^2 +", "50_correct": false, "50_changed": false}

To do this, we can use the method of completing the square or by recognizing the discriminant of the quadratic form.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the equation in matrix form:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x & y \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 7 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 12 & -2 \\\\ -2 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nFor the equation to represent a degenerate conic section (a point or a line), the matrix \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 7 \\end{pmatrix}\\) must be singular.

Find the minimum number of angles under the given conditions.\nassistant\n<think>\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of angles around a point and the constraints given. The angles around a point are supplementary, meaning they add up to 180 degrees. We are told that the measures of these angles are powers of the number 5. Let's denote the angles as \\(5^a\\), \\(5^b\\), \\(5^c\\), and \\(5^d\\), where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(d\\) are integers. The sum of these angles is:\n\\[5^a + 5^b + 5^c + 5^d = 180\\]\n\nWe need to find the minimum number of these angles that can sum up to 180 degrees. Let's start by considering the smallest possible values for \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(d\\).\n\nFirst, let's try the smallest powers of 5:\n\\[5^0 = 1, \\quad 5^1 = 5, \\quad 5^2 = 25, \\quad 5^3 = 125\\]\n\nWe need to find a combination of these that sums to 180. Let's start with the largest power of 5, which is 125:\n\\[125 + 55 = 180\\]\nHere, \\(5^3 = 125\\) and \\(5^1 = 5\\). This gives us two angles, which is a valid combination.\n\nTo confirm that this is the minimum number of angles, we need to check if we can get a smaller sum with fewer angles. If we use only one angle, the maximum value is 125, and the next largest is 125, which sums to 250, which is more than 180. If we use two angles, the maximum sum is 125 + 125 = 250, which is also more than 180. Therefore, the minimum number of angles that can sum to 180 is 2.\n\nThus, the minimum number of angles under the given conditions is 2.\n</think>\n<answer>\n2\n</answer>", "50_correct": false, "50_changed": false}

This is because if both make a shot, the total number of successful shots is 4, which is more than 3. If both miss a shot, the total number of successful shots is 2, which is not more than 3.

Let's start by examining the conditions more closely.\n\n1. $a_1 = 2021^{2021}$\n2. $0 \\le a_k < k$ for all integers $k \\ge 2$\n3. $a_1 - a_2 + a_3 - a_4 + \\cdots + (-1)^{k+1}a_k$ is a multiple of $k$ for all positive integers $k$.\n\nThe third condition suggests that the sequence alternates in a specific way. Let's denote the sum of the first $k$ terms as $S_k = a_1 - a_2 + a_3 - a_4 + \\cdots + (-1)^{k+1}a_k$. We know that $S_k$ is a multiple of $k$ for all $k$.\n\nTo find $a_{2021^{2022}}$, we need to understand the pattern of the sequence. Let's consider the first few terms to identify any patterns.\n\nFor $k=1$, we have $S_1 = a_1 = 2021^{2021}$, which is a multiple of 1.\n\nFor $k=2$, we have $S_2 = a_1 - a_2 = 2021^{2021} - a_2$. Since $0 \\le a_2 < 2$, $2021^{2021} - a_2$ is a multiple of 2. This means $a_2$ must be 0 (since $2021^{2021} - 0 = 2021^{2021}$, which is a multiple of 2).\n\nFor $k=3$, we have $S_3 = a_1 - a_2 + a_3 = 2021^{2021} - 0 + a_3$. Since $0 \\le a_3 < 3$, $2021^{2021} - 0 + a_3$ is a multiple of 3. This means $a_3$ must be 0 (since $2021^{2021} + 0 = 2021^{2021}$, which is a multiple of 3).\n\nWe can see that $a_2 = 0$ and $a_3 = 0$. This suggests that $a_k = 0$ for all $k \\ge 2$. Let's verify this pattern.\n\nFor $k=4$, we have $S_4 = a_1 - a_2 + a_3 - a_4 = 2021^{2021} - 0 + 0 - a_4$. Since $0 \\le a_4 < 4$, $2021^{2021} - 0 + 0 - a_4$ is a multiple of 4. This means $a_4$ must be 0 (since $2021^{2021} - 0 = 2021^{2021}$, which is a multiple of 4).\n\nFor $k=5$, we have $S_5 = a_1 - a_2 + a_3 - a_4 + a_5 = 2021^{2021} - 0 + 0 - 0 + a_5$. Since $0 \\le a_5 < 5$, $2021^{2021} - 0 + 0 - 0 + a_5$ is a multiple of 5. This means $a_5$ must be 0 (since $2021^{2021} - 0 = 2", "50_correct": false, "50_changed": true}

The mean is the sum of all weights divided by the number of children. The weights are 106 pounds, 5 pounds, 5 pounds, 6 pounds, and 8 pounds. The sum of these weights is 106 + 5 + 5 + 6 + 8 = 130 pounds. Since there are 5 children, the mean weight is 130 / 5 = 26 pounds.\n\nNext, let's calculate the median. The median is the middle value when the weights are arranged in ascending order. Arranging the weights in ascending order gives us 5, 5, 6, 8, 106 pounds. The middle value is 6 pounds.\n\nNow, we compare the mean and the median. The mean is 26 pounds, and the median is 6 pounds. The difference between the mean and the median is 26 - 6 = 20 pounds.\n\nTherefore, the median is larger, and the difference is 20 pounds.\n</answer>", "50_correct": false, "50_changed": true}

Marco's goal is to make a cell black that has more than two white neighbors, and Vera's goal is to prevent Marco from doing this by swapping the colors of neighboring cells. The key is to understand how Vera can use her $k$ turns to ensure that Marco cannot make a move that meets his criteria.\n\nVera's strategy involves swapping the colors of neighboring cells. If Vera can ensure that no two cells are neighbors to each other, then Marco cannot make a move that meets his criteria because he would need to swap the colors of two cells that are not neighbors. This means that Vera can guarantee a win if she can ensure that no two cells are neighbors to each other after her $k$ turns.\n\nTo achieve this, Vera needs to ensure that the grid is such that no two cells are neighbors to each other. This can be done by ensuring that the grid is a checkerboard pattern, where every black cell is surrounded by white cells and vice versa. This way, no cell has more than two white neighbors, and Marco cannot make a move that meets his criteria.\n\nNow, let's determine the minimal $k$ value such that Vera can guarantee a win.

However, we can try to find small prime numbers and see if they satisfy the equation.\n\nLet's start with the smallest prime numbers: \\(p = 2, q = 3, r = 5\\):\n\\[\n(p+1)(q+2)(r+3) = (2+1)(3+2)(5+3) = 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 8 = 120\n\\]\n\\[\n4pqr = 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 = 120\n\\]\n\nSince both sides are equal, \\((2, 3, 5)\\) is a solution. Now, let's check if there are any other solutions.\n\nWe can try other small prime numbers, but it's clear that the equation becomes increasingly complex as the primes increase. For example, if we try \\(p = 2, q = 3, r = 7\\):\n\\[\n(p+1)(q+2)(r+3) = (2+1)(3+2)(7+3) = 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 10 = 150\n\\]\n\\[\n4pqr = 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7 = 168\n\\]\n\nSince 150 is not equal to 168, \\((2, 3, 7)\\) is not a solution. Similarly, we can check other combinations of small prime numbers and find that none of them satisfy the equation.\n\nTherefore, the only solution to the equation \\((p+1)(q+2)(r+3) = 4pqr\\) for prime numbers \\(p, q, r\\) is \\((2, 3, 5)\\).\n</think>\n\n<answer>\nThe only solution to the equation \\((p+1)(q+2)(r+3) = 4pqr\\) for prime numbers \\(p, q, r\\) is \\((2, 3, 5)\\).\n</answer>", "50_correct": false, "50_changed": false}

Therefore, $BC$ is the height of the trapezoid.\n\nTo find the height, we can use the Pythagorean theorem.

Find all possible values for angle BCQ such that RST is equilateral.\nassistant\n<think>\nTo solve this problem, we need to analyze the geometric properties of the equilateral triangle ABC and the points M, N, P, Q, R, and S. We are given that RST is equilateral, and we need to find the possible values for angle BCQ.\n</think>\n<answer>\nLet's start by considering the properties of the equilateral triangle ABC. Since ABC is equilateral, all its internal angles are 60 degrees. The points M and N are the midpoints of AC and AB, respectively. This means that AM = MC and AN = NB.\nNow, let's consider the orthocenters R and S. The orthocenter of a triangle is the point where the altitudes intersect. In an equilateral triangle, the altitudes are also the angle bisectors and the medians. Therefore, R and S are the same point, which is the centroid of the triangle.\nSince RST is equilateral, the angles at R, S, and T must be equal. Let's denote the angle BCQ as x. We need to find the possible values for x such that RST is equilateral.\nTo do this, we can use the fact that the centroid divides each median in a 2:1 ratio. This means that the distance from the centroid to any vertex is twice the distance from the centroid to the midpoint of the opposite side.\nNow, let's consider the lines BP and CQ. Since RST is equilateral, the angles at R, S, and T must be equal. This means that the angles at B and C must also be equal. Therefore, the angle BCQ must be equal to the angle BRC.\nSince ABC is equilateral, the angle BRC is 60 degrees. Therefore, the angle BCQ must also be 60 degrees.\nHowever, we need to consider the possibility of other values for x. If we consider the case where the angle BCQ is 120 degrees, then the angle BRC would be 30 degrees. In this case, the angle RST would be 60 degrees, which is not equilateral.\nTherefore, the only possible value for angle BCQ such that RST is equilateral is 60 degrees.\n</answer>", "50_correct": false, "50_changed": false}

Since $S(n) \\equiv n \\pmod{9}$, we have $n \\equiv 100 \\pmod{9}$. Calculating $100 \\mod 9$, we get $100 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{9}$. Therefore, $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{9}$.\n\nNext, we are given that $S(44n) = 800$. Since $S(44n) \\equiv 44n \\pmod{9}$, we have $44n \\equiv 800 \\pmod{9}$. Calculating $44 \\mod 9$ and $800 \\mod 9$, we get $44 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{9}$ and $800 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{9}$. Therefore, $8n \\equiv 8 \\pmod{9}$.

In an isosceles right $\\triangle ABC$, it is known that $\\angle ABC=90^{\\circ}$, and the coordinates of points $A, B$ are $A(1,0), B(3,1)$, then the coordinates of vertex $C$ are $\\qquad$\nassistant\n<think>\nTo find the coordinates of vertex $C$ in an isosceles right triangle $\\triangle ABC$ with $\\angle ABC = 90^\\circ$, we can use the properties of right triangles and the Pythagorean theorem. Since $\\triangle ABC$ is isosceles and right-angled at $B$, the legs $AB$ and $BC$ are equal in length. We can use the distance formula to find the length of $AB$ and then use that to find the length of $BC$.\n\nThe distance formula is given by:\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \\]\n\nFirst, let's calculate the length of $AB$:\n\\[ AB = \\sqrt{(3 - 1)^2 + (1 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{2^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 1} = \\sqrt{5} \\]\n\nSince $AB = BC$ and $\\triangle ABC$ is isosceles, $BC$ is also $\\sqrt{5}$. Now, we need to find the coordinates of $C$. Let's assume $C$ has coordinates $(x, y)$. Since $C$ is directly above or below $B$ (because $\\angle ABC = 90^\\circ$), the y-coordinate of $C$ will be the same as that of $B$, which is 1. So, $y = 1$.\n\nNow, we use the distance formula to find the x-coordinate of $C$:\n\\[ BC = \\sqrt{(x - 3)^2 + (1 - 1)^2} = \\sqrt{(x - 3)^2} = |x - 3| \\]\n\nSince $BC = \\sqrt", "50_correct": false, "50_changed": true}
