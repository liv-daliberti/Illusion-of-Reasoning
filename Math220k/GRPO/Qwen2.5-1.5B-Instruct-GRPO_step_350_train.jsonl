The key insight is that if two altitudes are not smaller than the sides on which they are dropped, it implies that the triangle is isosceles. This is because in an isosceles triangle, the altitude from the vertex angle to the base is equal to the length of the base, and the altitude from the base angles to the opposite sides are equal to the lengths of the legs of the triangle.\n\nGiven that two altitudes are not smaller than the sides on which they are dropped, it means that the triangle must be isosceles with two equal sides. This implies that the angles opposite these equal sides must also be equal.\n\nLet's denote the angles of the triangle as \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\). Since the triangle is isosceles, we have two possible cases:\n1. \\(A = B\\)\n2. \\(A = C\\) or \\(B = C\\)\n\nHowever, since the triangle is isosceles and the altitudes are not smaller than the sides, the only possible configuration is that the triangle is isosceles with two equal angles.

If Anya gives half of her mushrooms to Vitya, all the children will have the same number of mushrooms, and if instead Anya gives all her mushrooms to Sasha, Sasha will have as many mushrooms as all the others combined. How many children went to pick mushrooms\nassistant\n<think>\nLet's denote the number of children as \\( n \\) and the number of mushrooms Anya has as \\( A \\). Let's also denote the number of mushrooms each child has as \\( m \\).\n\nFrom the problem, we know that if Anya gives half of her mushrooms to Vitya, all the children will have the same number of mushrooms. This means that after giving half of her mushrooms to Vitya, Anya will have \\( \\frac{A}{2} \\) mushrooms left, and each child will have \\( m + \\frac{A}{2n} \\) mushrooms. Since this is the same for all children, we can write:\n\\[ m + \\frac{A}{2n} = m \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ \\frac{A}{2n} = 0 \\]\nThis implies that \\( A = 0 \\), which is not possible since Anya has mushrooms. Instead, we need to consider the second condition, where Anya gives all her mushrooms to Sasha, and Sasha will have as many mushrooms as all the others combined. This means that after giving all her mushrooms to Sasha, Anya will have \\( A - m \\) mushrooms left, and Sasha will have \\( A \\) mushrooms. The remaining \\( n-1 \\) children will have \\( m \\) mushrooms each. So we can write:\n\\[ A - m = (n-1)m \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ A = (n-1)m + m \\]\n\\[ A = nm \\]\nNow, we need to find a value of \\( n \\) that satisfies this equation. Since \\( A \\) is the number of mushrooms Anya has, and it must be a positive integer, we can try different values of \\( n \\) to find a solution. Let's try \\( n = 4 \\):\n\\[ A = 4m \\]\nThis means Anya has 4 times as many mushrooms as each child.

This form is derived from the general equation of a hyperbola, $Ax^2 + By^2 = 1$, where $A = B$ for an equilateral hyperbola.\n\nGiven that the hyperbola passes through the point $M(4; -2)$, we can substitute these coordinates into the equation to find the value of $c^2$.\n\nThe equation of the hyperbola is:\n\\[xy = c^2\\]\n\nSubstituting $x = 4$ and $y = -2$ into the equation, we get:\n\\[4(-2) = c^2\\]\n\\[-8 = c^2\\]\n\nSince $c^2$ must be positive for the equation to represent a hyperbola, we take the positive square root of $-8$:\n\\[c^2 = 8\\]\n\nTherefore, the equation of the hyperbola is:\n\\[xy = 8\\]\n\nThis is the equation of the equilateral hyperbola with foci on the $O x$ axis, passing through the point $M(4; -2)$.\n</think>\n<answer>\n\\[xy = 8\\]\n</answer>", "350_correct": false, "350_changed": false}

Let's start by understanding the relationship between the cube and the pyramid.\n\nGiven that the cube is inscribed in the pyramid, the vertices of the cube's upper base lie on the lateral edges of the pyramid, and the vertices of the cube's lower base are in the plane of the pyramid's base. This configuration implies that the cube is oriented such that its edges are parallel to the edges of the pyramid.\n\nThe lateral edge of the pyramid makes an angle $\\alpha$ with the base plane. This angle helps us understand the spatial relationship between the pyramid and the cube.\n\nTo find the ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the pyramid, we need to consider the height of the pyramid and the side length of the cube. The height of the pyramid can be related to the angle $\\alpha$ and the side length of the cube.\n\nLet's denote the side length of the cube as $s$ and the height of the pyramid as $h$. The volume of the cube is $V_{\\text{cube}} = s^3$.\n\nThe volume of the pyramid is $V_{\\text{pyramid}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{Base Area} \\times \\text{Height} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times s^2 \\times h$.\n\nThe ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the pyramid is:\n\\[\n\\frac{V_{\\text{cube}}}{V_{\\text{pyramid}}} = \\frac{s^3}{\\frac{1}{3} s^2 h} = \\frac{3s}{h}\n\\]\n\nTo find $h$ in terms of $s$ and $\\alpha$, we use trigonometry. The height $h$ of the pyramid can be expressed as:\n\\[\nh = \\frac{s}{\\cos \\alpha}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting this into the ratio, we get:\n\\[\n\\frac{V_{\\text{cube}}}{V_{\\text{pyramid}}} = \\frac{3s}{\\frac{s}{\\cos \\alpha}} = 3 \\cos \\alpha\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the pyramid is $3 \\cos \\alpha$.\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the pyramid is $3 \\cos \\alpha$.\n</answer>", "350_correct": false, "350_changed": false}

Let's denote the angles of the triangle as $A$, $B$, and $C$, where $A + B + C = \\pi$.\n\nGiven that $A$, $B$, and $C$ are interior angles of a triangle, we know that $0 < A, B, C < \\pi$.

We can rewrite this as $\\cos A \\sin B + \\cos A \\sin C$.\n\nTo find the minimum value, we can use the fact that the sine function is maximized at $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and minimized at $0$ or $\\pi$. However, since $B$ and $C$ are angles of a triangle, they cannot be equal to $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ or $\\pi$.\n\nLet's consider the case when $B = C = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - A$. This is because if $B$ and $C$ are equal, then $A$ must be equal to $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, which is not possible since $A$ is an interior angle of a triangle.

The sequence starts from 1 and continues with all positive integers that are not perfect squares. We need to find the 2003rd term in this sequence.\n\nFirst, let's consider the number of perfect squares less than or equal to a given number \\( n \\). The number of perfect squares less than or equal to \\( n \\) is \\( \\lfloor \\sqrt{n} \\rfloor \\). Therefore, the number of terms in the sequence up to \\( n \\) is \\( n - \\lfloor \\sqrt{n} \\rfloor \\).\n\nWe need to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that the number of terms up to \\( n \\) is 2003. This means:\n\\[ n - \\lfloor \\sqrt{n} \\rfloor = 2003 \\]\n\nLet's estimate \\( n \\). If \\( n \\) is close to \\( 2003^2 \\), then \\( \\lfloor \\sqrt{n} \\rfloor \\approx 2003 \\).

The key condition is that the sum $S_k = a_1 - a_2 + a_3 - a_4 + \\cdots + (-1)^{k+1}a_k$ is a multiple of $k$ for all positive integers $k$. This implies that $S_k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{k}$.\n\nLet's start by examining the first few terms of the sequence to see if we can find a pattern or a way to determine $a_{2021^{2022}}$.\n\nGiven $a_1 = 2021^{2021}$, we can write:\n\\[ S_1 = a_1 = 2021^{2021} \\]\nSince $2021^{2021}$ is not divisible by 2, $S_1$ is not a multiple of 1. This suggests that the sequence might not follow a simple alternating pattern.\n\nNext, let's consider $S_2 = a_1 - a_2$. Since $0 \\le a_2 < 2$, we have:\n\\[ S_2 = 2021^{2021} - a_2 \\]\nFor $S_2$ to be a multiple of 2, $2021^{2021} - a_2$ must be even. Since $2021$ is odd, $2021^{2021}$ is also odd, and thus $2021^{2021} - a_2$ is even if and only if $a_2$ is odd.\n\nContinuing this logic, we can see that for $S_k$ to be a multiple of $k$, $a_k$ must be chosen such that the alternating sum of the sequence terms is always a multiple of $k$. This suggests that the sequence might be constructed in a way that the terms alternate in a specific pattern to satisfy the given conditions.\n\nGiven the complexity of the problem, we can infer that the sequence might be constructed in a way that the terms are chosen to satisfy the alternating sum condition. However, without a clear pattern, we cannot determine the exact value of $a_{2021^{2022}}$ directly.\n\nTo find the $2021^{2022}$th term, we would need to construct the sequence explicitly or find a pattern that satisfies the given conditions. However, based on the problem's constraints and the alternating sum condition, we can conclude that the sequence is constructed in a way that the terms are chosen to satisfy the given conditions.\n\nTherefore, the $2021^{2022}$th term of the sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ is not easily determined without constructing the sequence explicitly or finding a pattern that satisfies the given conditions.\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe $2021^{2022}$th term of the sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ cannot be determined directly from the given conditions without constructing the sequence explicitly or finding a pattern that satisfies the given conditions.\n</answer>", "350_correct": false, "350_changed": false}

Let's start by analyzing the equation and considering the properties of prime numbers.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the equation:\n\\[\n(p+1)(q+2)(r+3) = 4pqr\n\\]\n\nWe can expand the left-hand side:\n\\[\n(p+1)(q+2)(r+3) = pqr + 3pq + 2pr + r + 2p + q + 6r + 6\n\\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\\[\npqr + 3pq + 2pr + r + 2p + q + 6r + 6 = 4pqr\n\\]\n\nRearranging terms, we get:\n\\[\n3pq + 2pr + r + 2p + q + 6r + 6 = 3pqr\n\\]\n\nThis equation is quite complex, and it's not immediately clear how to solve it directly. However, we can try to find specific values of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\) that might satisfy this equation.\n\nLet's consider the case where \\(p = q = r\\). If \\(p = q = r\\), then the equation simplifies to:\n\\[\n(p+1)(p+2)(p+3) = 4p^3\n\\]\n\nExpanding the left-hand side:\n\\[\n(p+1)(p+2)(p+3) = p^3 + 6p^2 + 11p + 6\n\\]\n\nSo, we have:\n\\[\np^3 + 6p^2 + 11p + 6 = 4p^3\n\\]\n\nRearranging terms, we get:\n\\[\n3p^3 - 6p^2 - 11p - 6 = 0\n\\]\n\nThis is a cubic equation in \\(p\\). We can try to find integer solutions by testing small prime numbers. Let's test \\(p = 2\\):\n\\[\n3(2)^3 - 6(2)^2 - 11(2) - 6 = 3(8) - 6(4) - 22 - 6 = 24 - 24 - 22 - 6 = -22 \\neq 0\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(p = 2\\) is not a solution. Let's try \\(p = 3\\):\n\\[\n3(3)^3 - 6(3)^2 - 11(3) - 6 = 3(27) - 6(9) - 33 - 6 = 81 - 54 - 33 - 6 = 0\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(p = 3\\) is a solution. Therefore, one solution is \\((p, q, r) = (3, 3, 3)\\).\n\nWe can also consider the case where \\(p = q\\) and \\(r\\) is a different prime. Let's try \\(p = 2\\) and \\(r = 3\\):\n\\[\n(2+1)(2+2)(3+3) = 4(2)(3) = 24\n\\]\n\\[\n4(2)(3)(3) = 4(18) = 72\n\\]\n\nThis does not satisfy the equation. Let's try \\(p = 2\\) and \\(r = 5\\):\n\\[\n(2+1)(2+2)(5+3) = 3(4)(8) = 96\n\\]\n\\[\n4(2)(5)(3) = 4(30) = 120\n\\]\n\nThis does not satisfy the equation either. After testing several values, we find that the only solution is \\((p, q, r) = (3, 3, 3)\\).\n\nTherefore, the only triple of primes that satisfies the equation is \\((3, 3, 3)\\).\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe only triple of primes \\((p, q, r)\\) that satisfies the equation \\((p+1)(q+2)(r+3) = 4pqr\\) is \\((3, 3, 3)\\).\n</answer>", "350_correct": false, "350_changed": false}

We are given that RST is equilateral, and we need to find the possible values for angle BCQ.\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe key to solving this problem is to recognize that the orthocenter of a triangle is the point where the altitudes intersect. In an equilateral triangle, all altitudes are the same length and are also the angle bisectors and medians. Therefore, the orthocenter, circumcenter, and centroid of an equilateral triangle coincide at the same point.\nSince RST is equilateral, the angles at R, S, and T must be 60 degrees. This means that the angles at B and C in triangle ABC must also be 60 degrees, because the orthocenter of triangle ABC is the same as the orthocenter of triangle RST.\nTherefore, the only possible value for angle BCQ is 60 degrees.\n</answer>", "350_correct": false, "350_changed": false}

When a point is symmetric to another point with respect to the x-axis, their x-coordinates remain the same, but their y-coordinates are negatives of each other. Similarly, when a point is symmetric to another point with respect to the y-axis, their y-coordinates remain the same, but their x-coordinates are negatives of each other.\n\nGiven point $P_{1}(3, a)$ is symmetric to point $P_{2}(b, -2)$ with respect to the x-axis, we can deduce that:\n- The x-coordinate of $P_{1}$ is the same as the x-coordinate of $P_{2}$, so $3 = b$.\n- The y-coordinate of $P_{1}$ is the negative of the y-coordinate of $P_{2}$, so $a = -(-2) = 2$.\n\nNow, to find the coordinates of the point $P_{1}$ symmetric to the y-axis, we change the sign of the x-coordinate while keeping the y-coordinate the same. So, the symmetric point to $P_{1}(3, 2)$ with respect to the y-axis is $P_{3}(3, 2)$.\n\nTo find the coordinates of the point $P_{1}$ symmetric to the origin, we change the signs of both the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate.
