The key insight is that if two altitudes are not smaller than the sides on which they are dropped, it implies that the triangle is isosceles. This is because in an isosceles triangle, the altitude from the vertex angle to the base is equal to the length of the base, and the altitude from the base angles to the opposite sides are equal to the lengths of the legs of the triangle.\n\nGiven that two altitudes are not smaller than the sides on which they are dropped, it means that the triangle must be isosceles with two equal sides. This implies that the angles opposite these equal sides must also be equal.\n\nLet's denote the angles of the triangle as \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\). Since the triangle is isosceles, we have two possible cases:\n1. \\(A = B\\)\n2. \\(A = C\\) or \\(B = C\\)\n\nHowever, since the triangle is isosceles and the altitudes are not smaller than the sides, the only possible configuration is that the triangle is isosceles with two equal angles.

If Anya gives half of her mushrooms to Vitya, all the children will have the same number of mushrooms, and if instead Anya gives all her mushrooms to Sasha, Sasha will have as many mushrooms as all the others combined. How many children went to pick mushrooms\nassistant\n<think>\nLet's denote the number of children as \\( n \\) and the number of mushrooms Anya has as \\( A \\). Let's also denote the number of mushrooms each child has as \\( m \\).\n\nFrom the problem, we know that if Anya gives half of her mushrooms to Vitya, all the children will have the same number of mushrooms. This means that after giving half of her mushrooms to Vitya, Anya will have \\( \\frac{A}{2} \\) mushrooms left, and each child will have \\( m + \\frac{A}{2n} \\) mushrooms. Since this is the same for all children, we can write:\n\\[ m + \\frac{A}{2n} = m \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ \\frac{A}{2n} = 0 \\]\nThis implies that \\( A = 0 \\), which is not possible since Anya has mushrooms. Instead, we need to consider the second condition, where Anya gives all her mushrooms to Sasha, and Sasha will have as many mushrooms as all the others combined. This means that after giving all her mushrooms to Sasha, Anya will have \\( A - m \\) mushrooms left, and Sasha will have \\( A \\) mushrooms. The remaining \\( n-1 \\) children will have \\( m \\) mushrooms each. So we can write:\n\\[ A - m = (n-1)m \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ A = (n-1)m + m \\]\n\\[ A = nm \\]\nNow, we need to find a value of \\( n \\) that satisfies this equation. Since \\( A \\) is the number of mushrooms Anya has, and it must be a positive integer, we can try different values of \\( n \\) to find a solution. Let's try \\( n = 4 \\):\n\\[ A = 4m \\]\nThis means Anya has 4 times as many mushrooms as each child. If Anya gives half of her mushrooms to Vitya, she will have \\( 2m \\) mushrooms left, and each child will have \\( m + m = 2", "350_correct": false, "350_changed": false}

Substituting \\( f(x) = kx \\) into the original equation, we get:\n\n\\[\nf(x f(x+y)) = f(x k(x+y)) = k^2 x (x+y)\n\\]\n\nAnd the right-hand side becomes:\n\n\\[\ny f(x) + 1 = y kx + 1\n\\]\n\nEquating both sides, we have:\n\n\\[\nk^2 x (x+y) = y kx + 1\n\\]\n\nFor this to hold for all \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), the coefficients of \\( x \\) and the constant terms must match on both sides.

Form the equation of an equilateral hyperbola with foci on the $O x$ axis, passing through the point $M(4; -2)$.\nassistant\n<think>\nTo form the equation of an equilateral hyperbola with foci on the $O x$ axis, we start with the standard form of an equilateral hyperbola, which is given by $xy = c^2$. This form is derived from the general equation of a hyperbola, $Ax^2 + By^2 = 1$, where $A = B$ for an equilateral hyperbola.\n\nGiven that the hyperbola passes through the point $M(4; -2)$, we can substitute these coordinates into the equation to find the value of $c^2$.\n\nThe equation of the hyperbola is:\n\\[xy = c^2\\]\n\nSubstituting $x = 4$ and $y = -2$ into the equation, we get:\n\\[4(-2) = c^2\\]\n\\[-8 = c^2\\]\n\nSince $c^2$ must be positive for the equation to represent a hyperbola, we take the positive square root of $-8$:\n\\[c^2 = 8\\]\n\nTherefore, the equation of the hyperbola is:\n\\[xy = 8\\]\n\nThis is the equation of the equilateral hyperbola with foci on the $O x$ axis, passing through the point $M(4; -2)$.\n</think>\n<answer>\n\\[xy = 8\\]\n</answer>", "350_correct": false, "350_changed": false}

A cube is inscribed in a regular quadrilateral pyramid; the vertices of its upper base lie on the lateral edges, and the vertices of its lower base are in the plane of the pyramid's base. Find the ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the pyramid, if the lateral edge of the pyramid makes an angle $\\alpha$ with the base plane.\nassistant\n<think>\nTo find the ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the pyramid, we need to consider the geometric properties of the pyramid and the cube. Let's start by understanding the relationship between the cube and the pyramid.\n\nGiven that the cube is inscribed in the pyramid, the vertices of the cube's upper base lie on the lateral edges of the pyramid, and the vertices of the cube's lower base are in the plane of the pyramid's base. This configuration implies that the cube is oriented such that its edges are parallel to the edges of the pyramid.\n\nThe lateral edge of the pyramid makes an angle $\\alpha$ with the base plane. This angle helps us understand the spatial relationship between the pyramid and the cube.\n\nTo find the ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the pyramid, we need to consider the height of the pyramid and the side length of the cube. The height of the pyramid can be related to the angle $\\alpha$ and the side length of the cube.\n\nLet's denote the side length of the cube as $s$ and the height of the pyramid as $h$. The volume of the cube is $V_{\\text{cube}} = s^3$.\n\nThe volume of the pyramid is $V_{\\text{pyramid}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{Base Area} \\times \\text{Height} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times s^2 \\times h$.\n\nThe ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the pyramid is:\n\\[\n\\frac{V_{\\text{cube}}}{V_{\\text{pyramid}}} = \\frac{s^3}{\\frac{1}{3} s^2 h} = \\frac{3s}{h}\n\\]\n\nTo find $h$ in terms of $s$ and $\\alpha$, we use trigonometry. The height $h$ of the pyramid can be expressed as:\n\\[\nh = \\frac{s}{\\cos \\alpha}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting this into the ratio, we get:\n\\[\n\\frac{V_{\\text{cube}}}{V_{\\text{pyramid}}} = \\frac{3s}{\\frac{s}{\\cos \\alpha}} = 3 \\cos \\alpha\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the pyramid is $3 \\cos \\alpha$.\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the pyramid is $3 \\cos \\alpha$.\n</answer>", "350_correct": false, "350_changed": false}

Let's denote the angles of the triangle as $A$, $B$, and $C$, where $A + B + C = \\pi$.\n\nGiven that $A$, $B$, and $C$ are interior angles of a triangle, we know that $0 < A, B, C < \\pi$.

We can rewrite this as $\\cos A \\sin B + \\cos A \\sin C$.\n\nTo find the minimum value, we can use the fact that the sine function is maximized at $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and minimized at $0$ or $\\pi$. However, since $B$ and $C$ are angles of a triangle, they cannot be equal to $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ or $\\pi$.\n\nLet's consider the case when $B = C = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - A$. This is because if $B$ and $C$ are equal, then $A$ must be equal to $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, which is not possible since $A$ is an interior angle of a triangle. Therefore, we need to consider the case when $B$ and $C$ are close to $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nIn this case, we have $\\sin B = \\sin C = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - A) = \\cos A$. Therefore, the expression becomes $\\cos A \\cos A = \\cos^2 A$.\n\nNow, we need to find the minimum value of $\\cos^2 A$.
