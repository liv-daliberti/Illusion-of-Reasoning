Find the angles of the triangle.\nassistant\n<think>\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the altitudes and the sides of a triangle. The key insight is that if two altitudes are not smaller than the sides on which they are dropped, it implies that the triangle is isosceles. This is because in an isosceles triangle, the altitude from the vertex angle to the base is equal to the length of the base, and the altitude from the base angles to the opposite sides are equal to the lengths of the legs of the triangle.\n\nGiven that two altitudes are not smaller than the sides on which they are dropped, it means that the triangle must be isosceles with two equal sides. This implies that the angles opposite these equal sides must also be equal.\n\nLet's denote the angles of the triangle as \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\). Since the triangle is isosceles, we have two possible cases:\n1. \\(A = B\\)\n2. \\(A = C\\) or \\(B = C\\)\n\nHowever, since the triangle is isosceles, the angles opposite the equal sides must be equal. Therefore, the only possible configuration is \\(A = B\\).\n\nNow, we know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is \\(180^\\circ\\). So, we have:\n\\[A + B + C = 180^\\circ\\]\nSince \\(A = B\\), we can substitute \\(B\\) with \\(A\\):\n\\[A + A + C = 180^\\circ\\]\n\\[2A + C = 180^\\circ\\]\n\nSince \\(A = B\\) and the triangle is isosceles, the angles must be such that the sum of the angles is \\(180^\\circ\\). The only way to satisfy this condition is if the triangle is a right triangle with one angle being \\(90^\\circ\\).

This means that after giving half of her mushrooms to Vitya, Anya will have \\( \\frac{A}{2} \\) mushrooms left, and each child will have \\( m + \\frac{A}{2n} \\) mushrooms. Since this is the same for all children, we can write:\n\\[ m + \\frac{A}{2n} = m \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ \\frac{A}{2n} = 0 \\]\nThis implies that \\( A = 0 \\), which is not possible since Anya has mushrooms. So, let's consider the second condition.\n\nIf Anya gives all her mushrooms to Sasha, Sasha will have as many mushrooms as all the others combined. This means that after giving all her mushrooms to Sasha, Anya will have \\( A - m \\) mushrooms left, and Sasha will have \\( A \\) mushrooms.

Form the equation of an equilateral hyperbola with foci on the $O x$ axis, passing through the point $M(4; -2)$.\nassistant\n<think>\nTo form the equation of an equilateral hyperbola with foci on the $O x$ axis, we start with the standard form of an equilateral hyperbola, which is given by $xy = c^2$. This form is derived from the general equation of a hyperbola, $Ax^2 + By^2 = 1$, where $A = B$ for an equilateral hyperbola.\n\nGiven that the hyperbola passes through the point $M(4; -2)$, we can substitute these coordinates into the equation to find the value of $c^2$.\n\nThe equation of the hyperbola is:\n\\[xy = c^2\\]\n\nSubstituting $x = 4$ and $y = -2$ into the equation, we get:\n\\[4(-2) = c^2\\]\n\\[-8 = c^2\\]\n\nSince $c^2$ must be positive for the equation to represent a hyperbola, we take the positive square root of $-8$:\n\\[c^2 = 8\\]\n\nTherefore, the equation of the hyperbola is:\n\\[xy = 8\\]\n\nThis is the equation of the equilateral hyperbola with foci on the $O x$ axis, passing through the point $M(4; -2)$.\n</think>\n<answer>\n\\[xy = 8\\]\n</answer>", "250_correct": false, "250_changed": false}

On how many arrays is this possible?\nassistant\n<think>\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the properties of the operations and how they affect the array modulo 2013. The key insight is that the operations are essentially modulo 2013, and we need to ensure that after applying these operations, all entries in the array are divisible by 2013.\n\nLet's analyze the operations:\n1. Subtracting 1 from each entry in a row is equivalent to adding 2012 to each entry in that row modulo 2013.\n2. Adding 1 to each entry in a column is equivalent to subtracting 2012 from each entry in that column modulo 2013.\n\nThe goal is to ensure that after applying these operations, all entries in the array are divisible by 2013. This means that the sum of all entries in the array modulo 2013 must be 0.\n\nLet's consider the initial sum of all entries in the array modulo 2013. Since each entry is between 1 and 2013, the sum of all entries modulo 2013 is between 1 and 2013. If we subtract 1 from each entry in a row, the sum of all entries modulo 2013 will be reduced by 2012 times the number of rows. Similarly, if we add 1 to each entry in a column, the sum of all entries modulo 2013 will be increased by 2012 times the number of columns.\n\nFor the sum of all entries to be 0 modulo 2013, the net effect of the operations must be such that the sum is 0. This means that the number of rows and columns that are affected by the operations must be such that the net effect is a multiple of 2013.\n\nGiven that the array is \\(2013 \\times 2013\\), we can see that the operations will always result in a net effect that is a multiple of 2013. This is because the operations are essentially modulo 2013, and the sum of all entries modulo 2013 will always be 0 if the number of rows and columns that are affected by the operations is such that the net effect is a multiple of 2013.\n\nTherefore, the number of possible arrays is the number of ways to choose the rows and columns that are affected by the operations, which is \\(2013\\) (since we can choose any row or column to be affected by the operations).\n\nThe answer is \\(2013\\).\n</think>\n<answer>\n2013\n</answer>", "250_correct": false, "250_changed": false}
