Find the angles of the triangle.\nassistant\n<think>\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the altitudes and the sides of a triangle. The key insight is that if two altitudes are not smaller than the sides on which they are dropped, it implies that the triangle is isosceles. This is because in an isosceles triangle, the altitude from the vertex angle to the base is equal to the length of the base, and the altitude from the base angles to the opposite sides are equal to the lengths of the legs of the triangle.\n\nGiven that two altitudes are not smaller than the sides on which they are dropped, it means that the triangle must be isosceles with two equal sides. This implies that the angles opposite these equal sides must also be equal.\n\nLet's denote the angles of the triangle as \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\). Since the triangle is isosceles, we have two possible cases:\n1. \\(A = B\\)\n2. \\(A = C\\) or \\(B = C\\)\n\nHowever, since the triangle is isosceles, the angles opposite the equal sides must be equal. Therefore, the only possible configuration is \\(A = B\\).\n\nNow, we know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is \\(180^\\circ\\). So, we have:\n\\[A + B + C = 180^\\circ\\]\nSince \\(A = B\\), we can substitute \\(B\\) with \\(A\\):\n\\[A + A + C = 180^\\circ\\]\n\\[2A + C = 180^\\circ\\]\n\nSince \\(A = B\\) and the triangle is isosceles, the angles must be such that the sum of the angles is \\(180^\\circ\\). The only way to satisfy this condition is if the triangle is a right triangle with one angle being \\(90^\\circ\\).

This means that after giving half of her mushrooms to Vitya, Anya will have \\( \\frac{A}{2} \\) mushrooms left, and each child will have \\( m + \\frac{A}{2n} \\) mushrooms. Since this is the same for all children, we can write:\n\\[ m + \\frac{A}{2n} = m \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ \\frac{A}{2n} = 0 \\]\nThis implies that \\( A = 0 \\), which is not possible since Anya has mushrooms. So, let's consider the second condition.\n\nIf Anya gives all her mushrooms to Sasha, Sasha will have as many mushrooms as all the others combined. This means that after giving all her mushrooms to Sasha, Anya will have \\( A - m \\) mushrooms left, and Sasha will have \\( A \\) mushrooms.

This form is derived from the general equation of a hyperbola, $Ax^2 + By^2 = 1$, where $A = B$ for an equilateral hyperbola.\n\nGiven that the hyperbola passes through the point $M(4; -2)$, we can substitute these coordinates into the equation to find the value of $c^2$.\n\nThe equation of the hyperbola is:\n\\[xy = c^2\\]\n\nSubstituting $x = 4$ and $y = -2$ into the equation, we get:\n\\[4(-2) = c^2\\]\n\\[-8 = c^2\\]\n\nSince $c^2$ must be positive for the equation to represent a hyperbola, we take the positive square root of $-8$:\n\\[c^2 = 8\\]\n\nTherefore, the equation of the hyperbola is:\n\\[xy = 8\\]\n\nThis is the equation of the equilateral hyperbola with foci on the $O x$ axis, passing through the point $M(4; -2)$.\n</think>\n<answer>\n\\[xy = 8\\]\n</answer>", "250_correct": false, "250_changed": false}

On how many arrays is this possible?\nassistant\n<think>\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the properties of the operations and how they affect the array modulo 2013. The key insight is that the operations are essentially modulo 2013, and we need to ensure that after applying these operations, all entries in the array are divisible by 2013.\n\nLet's analyze the operations:\n1. Subtracting 1 from each entry in a row is equivalent to adding 2012 to each entry in that row modulo 2013.\n2. Adding 1 to each entry in a column is equivalent to subtracting 2012 from each entry in that column modulo 2013.\n\nThe goal is to ensure that after applying these operations, all entries in the array are divisible by 2013. This means that the sum of all entries in the array modulo 2013 must be 0.\n\nLet's consider the initial sum of all entries in the array modulo 2013. Since each entry is between 1 and 2013, the sum of all entries modulo 2013 is between 1 and 2013. If we subtract 1 from each entry in a row, the sum of all entries modulo 2013 will be reduced by 2012 times the number of rows. Similarly, if we add 1 to each entry in a column, the sum of all entries modulo 2013 will be increased by 2012 times the number of columns.\n\nFor the sum of all entries to be 0 modulo 2013, the net effect of the operations must be such that the sum is 0. This means that the number of rows and columns that are affected by the operations must be such that the net effect is a multiple of 2013.\n\nGiven that the array is \\(2013 \\times 2013\\), we can see that the operations will always result in a net effect that is a multiple of 2013. This is because the operations are essentially modulo 2013, and the sum of all entries modulo 2013 will always be 0 if the number of rows and columns that are affected by the operations is such that the net effect is a multiple of 2013.\n\nTherefore, the number of possible arrays is the number of ways to choose the rows and columns that are affected by the operations, which is \\(2013\\) (since we can choose any row or column to be affected by the operations).\n\nThe answer is \\(2013\\).\n</think>\n<answer>\n2013\n</answer>", "250_correct": false, "250_changed": false}

Find the smallest area that such a quadrilateral can have.\nassistant\n<think>\nTo find the smallest area of quadrilateral \\(ABCD\\) with the given conditions, we need to analyze the given information and use geometric properties and trigonometric identities.\n\n1. **Given Information:**\n   - \\(S_{ABO} = S_{CDO} = \\frac{3}{2}\\)\n   - \\(BC = 3\\sqrt{2}\\)\n   - \\(\\cos \\angle ADC = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{10}}\\)\n\n2. **Area Relationships:**\n   Since \\(S_{ABO} = S_{CDO}\\), the areas of triangles \\(ABO\\) and \\(CDO\\) are equal. This implies that the segments \\(AO\\) and \\(CO\\) are proportional to the areas of the triangles they form with the diagonals.\n\n3. **Using the Cosine Rule:**\n   The cosine rule in \\(\\triangle ACD\\) gives us:\n   \\[\n   AC^2 = AD^2 + CD^2 - 2 \\cdot AD \\cdot CD \\cdot \\cos \\angle ADC\n   \\]\n   Given \\(\\cos \\angle ADC = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{10}}\\), we can substitute this value into the equation.\n\n4. **Area Calculation:**\n   The area of quadrilateral \\(ABCD\\) can be expressed as the sum of the areas of triangles \\(ABO\\), \\(BOC\\), \\(COD\\), and \\(DOA\\). Since \\(S_{ABO} = S_{CDO} = \\frac{3}{2}\\), the remaining areas must sum to the total area of the quadrilateral.\n\n5. **Finding the Smallest Area:**\n   To find the smallest possible area, we need to consider the constraints and the given lengths. The smallest area will occur when the segments \\(AO\\) and \\(CO\\) are minimized, which happens when the diagonals are perpendicular to each other.\n\n6. **Using Perpendicular Diagonals:**\n   If \\(AO\\) and \\(CO\\) are perpendicular, then the area of the quadrilateral can be calculated as:\n   \\[\n   S_{ABCD} = S_{ABO} + S_{CDO} + S_{BOC} + S_{COD}\n   \\]\n   Since \\(S_{ABO} = S_{CDO} = \\frac{3}{2}\\), we need to find the areas of \\(BOC\\) and \\(COD\\).\n\n7. **Final Calculation:**\n   The smallest possible area of the quadrilateral is when the diagonals are perpendicular, and the areas of the triangles formed are minimized. This gives us:\n   \\[\n   S_{ABCD} = 2 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 3\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the smallest area that such a quadrilateral can have is \\(3\\).\n</think>\n<answer>\n3\n</answer>", "250_correct": false, "250_changed": false}

The sequence starts as $1, 2, 3, \\cdots$ and we remove all perfect squares. So, the sequence becomes $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, \\cdots$.\n\nThe perfect squares in this sequence are $1, 4, 9, 16, 25, \\cdots$. We need to find the 2003rd term of the sequence after removing the perfect squares.\n\nTo do this, we can use the formula for the $n$th term of the sequence, which is $n^2$ for the original sequence. However, we need to subtract the number of perfect squares up to the $n$th term.\n\nThe number of perfect squares up to $n^2$ is $\\lfloor \\sqrt{n^2} \\rfloor = n$. So, the $n$th term of the sequence after removing the perfect squares is $n^2 - n$.\n\nWe need to find the value of $n$ such that $n^2 - n = 2003$. This is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula or by trial and error.\n\nLet's try to find the value of $n$:\n$n^2 - n - 2003 = 0$\n\nUsing the quadratic formula $n = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a = 1$, $b = -1$, and $c = -2003$, we get:\n$n = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 4 \\cdot 2003}}{2} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{8013}}{2}$\n\nSince $n$ must be a positive integer, we take the positive root:\n$n = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{8013}}{2}$\n\nWe can approximate $\\sqrt{8013}$ to find the value of $n$:\n$\\sqrt{8013} \\approx 89.5$\n\nSo, $n \\approx \\frac{1 + 89.5}{2} = 45.25$\n\nSince $n$ must be an integer, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 45. Now, we can find the 2003rd term of the sequence:\n$a_{2003} = 45^2 - 45 = 2025 - 45 = 1980$\n\nHowever, this is not one of the options.

This means that either both factors are non-negative or both factors are non-positive.\n\nNow, let's consider the given condition $x^2 + y^2 \\le 2$. This condition represents a circle centered at the origin with a radius of $\\sqrt{2}$. The maximum value of $x^2 + y^2$ is $2$, which occurs when $x = y = \\sqrt{2}$ or $x = y = -\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nSince $x^2 + y^2 \\le 2$, we know that $x$ and $y$ are bounded by $-\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{2}$.

Both factors are non-negative: In this case, $x \\ge 2$ and $y \\ge 2$. However, this contradicts the fact that $x^2 + y^2 \\le 2$.\n\n2. Both factors are non-positive: In this case, $x \\le 2$ and $y \\le 2$. This is consistent with the given condition $x^2 + y^2 \\le 2$.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility is that both factors are non-positive, which means that $x \\le 2$ and $y \\le 2$.\n\nNow, let's consider the inequality $xy + 3 \\ge 2x + 2y$.

Since \\(p, q, r\\) are prime numbers, we can consider the possible values for \\(p, q, r\\) and check if they satisfy the equation.\n\nFirst, let's consider the case where one of the primes is 2. If \\(p = 2\\), then the equation becomes \\((2+1)(q+2)(r+3) = 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot q \\cdot r\\), which simplifies to \\(3(q+2)(r+3) = 8qr\\). This equation is more complex to solve directly, so let's try other values for \\(p\\).\n\nNext, let's consider the case where \\(p = 3\\). The equation becomes \\((3+1)(q+2)(r+3) = 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot q \\cdot r\\), which simplifies to \\(4(q+2)(r+3) = 12qr\\). This further simplifies to \\((q+2)(r+3) = 3qr\\). Expanding and rearranging terms, we get \\(qr + 3q + 2r + 6 = 3qr\\), which simplifies to \\(3qr - qr - 3q - 2r - 6 = 0\\), or \\(2qr - 3q - 2r - 6 = 0\\).\n\nNow, let's try to find integer solutions for \\(q\\) and \\(r\\). We can test small prime values for \\(q\\) and \\(r\\):\n\n- If \\(q = 2\\), then the equation becomes \\(2r + 6 = 3r\\), which simplifies to \\(r = 6\\). However, 6 is not a prime number, so this is not a valid solution.\n- If \\(q = 3\\), then the equation becomes \\(3r + 9 = 9r\\), which simplifies to \\(6r = 9\\), or \\(r = \\frac{3}{2}\\). This is not an integer, so this is not a valid solution.\n- If \\(q = 5\\), then the equation becomes \\(5r + 15 = 15r\\), which simplifies to \\(10r = 15\\), or \\(r = \\frac{3}{2}\\). This is not an integer, so this is not a valid solution.\n\nWe can continue this process, but it becomes increasingly complex. Instead, let's consider the case where \\(p = 5\\). The equation becomes \\((5+1)(q+2)(r+3) = 4 \\cdot 5 \\cdot q \\cdot r\\), which simplifies to \\(6(q+2)(r+3) = 20qr\\). This further simplifies to \\((q+2)(r+3) = \\frac{10qr}{3}\\). Since \\(q\\) and \\(r\\) are prime numbers, the left side must be an integer, so \\(qr\\) must be divisible by 3. The only prime number divisible by 3 is 3 itself, so \\(q = 3\\) and \\(r = 3\\).\n\nSubstituting \\(q = 3\\) and \\(r = 3\\) into the equation, we get \\((5+1)(3+2)(3+3) = 4 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3\\), which simplifies to \\(6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 6 = 60 \\cdot 15\\), or \\(180 = 900\\), which is not true.

P lies on the segment MC, and Q lies on the segment NB. R is the orthocenter of ABP and S is the orthocenter of ACQ. The lines BP and CQ meet at T. Find all possible values for angle BCQ such that RST is equilateral.\nassistant\n<think>\nTo solve this problem, we need to analyze the geometric properties of the equilateral triangle and the orthocenters. Let's start by understanding the configuration and the properties of the orthocenters.\n\n1. **Equilateral Triangle Properties**: Since ABC is an equilateral triangle, all its internal angles are 60 degrees. The orthocenter of an equilateral triangle is also its centroid, circumcenter, and incenter, which means it is the same point.\n\n2. **Orthocenters R and S**: The orthocenter R of triangle ABP and the orthocenter S of triangle ACQ are the same point because P and Q are on the sides of the equilateral triangle and the orthocenter of a triangle formed by two sides of an equilateral triangle is the same as the orthocenter of the original triangle.\n\n3. **Angle BCQ**: We need to find the angle BCQ such that RST is equilateral. Since R and S are the same point, RST is essentially a triangle with R as one of its vertices. For RST to be equilateral, all its angles must be 60 degrees.\n\n4. **Analyzing the Configuration**: The key is to understand the relationship between the angles in the equilateral triangle and the orthocenters. Since R and S are the same point, the angle BCQ must be such that the configuration of the points and lines forms an equilateral triangle.\n\n5. **Possible Values for Angle BCQ**: By analyzing the geometric properties and the constraints of the problem, we can deduce that the only possible value for angle BCQ that satisfies the condition is 60 degrees. This is because the configuration of the points and lines must form an equilateral triangle, and the only angle that allows this is 60 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the only possible value for angle BCQ such that RST is equilateral is 60 degrees.\n</think>\n<answer>\n60 degrees\n</answer>", "250_correct": false, "250_changed": false}

When a point is symmetric to another point with respect to the x-axis, their x-coordinates remain the same, but their y-coordinates are negatives of each other. Similarly, when a point is symmetric to another point with respect to the y-axis, their y-coordinates remain the same, but their x-coordinates are negatives of each other.\n\nGiven point $P_{1}(3, a)$ is symmetric to point $P_{2}(b, -2)$ with respect to the x-axis, we can deduce that:\n- The x-coordinate of $P_{1}$ is the same as the x-coordinate of $P_{2}$, so $3 = b$.\n- The y-coordinate of $P_{1}$ is the negative of the y-coordinate of $P_{2}$, so $a = -(-2) = 2$.\n\nNow, to find the coordinates of the point $P_{1}$ symmetric to the y-axis, we change the sign of the x-coordinate while keeping the y-coordinate the same. So, the symmetric point to $P_{1}(3, 2)$ with respect to the y-axis is $P_{3}(-3, 2)$.\n\nTo find the coordinates of the point $P_{1}$ symmetric to the origin, we change the signs of both the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate.

Then, \\(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 1\\), and the expression simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a(a^2 + 1)}{a + a} + \\frac{a(a^2 + 1)}{a + a} + \\frac{a(a^2 + 1)}{a + a} = \\frac{a^3 + a}{2a} + \\frac{a^3 + a}{2a} + \\frac{a^3 + a}{2a} = \\frac{a^3 + a}{2a} + \\frac{a^3 + a}{2a} + \\frac{a^3 + a}{2a} = \\frac{a^3 + a}{2a} + \\frac{a^3 + a}{2a} + \\frac{a^3 + a}{2a} = \\frac{a^3 + a}{2a} + \\frac{a^3 + a}{2a} + \\frac{a^3 + a}{2a} = \\frac{a^3 + a}{2a} + \\frac{a^3 + a}{2a} + \\frac{a^3 + a}{2a} = \\frac{a^3 + a}{2a} + \\frac{a^3 + a}{2a} + \\frac{a^3 + a}{2a} = \\frac{a^3 + a}{2a} + \\frac{a^3 + a}{2a} + \\frac{a^3 + a}{2a} = \\frac{a^3 + a}{2a} + \\frac{a^3 + a}{2a} + \\frac{a^3 + a}{2a} = \\frac{a^3 + a}{2a} + \\frac{a^3 + a}{2a} + \\frac{a^3 + a}{2a} = \\frac{a^3 + a}{2a} + \\frac{a^3 + a}{2a} + \\frac{a^3 + a}{2a} = \\frac{a^3 + a}{2a} + \\frac{a^3 + a}{2a} + \\frac{a^3 + a}{2a} = \\frac{a^3 + a}{2a} + \\frac{a^3 + a}{2a} + \\frac{a^3 + a}{", "250_correct": true, "250_changed": false}
