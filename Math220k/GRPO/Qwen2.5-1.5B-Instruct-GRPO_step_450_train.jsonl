Find the angles of the triangle.\nassistant\n<think>\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the altitudes and the sides of a triangle. The key insight is that if two altitudes are not smaller than the sides on which they are dropped, it implies that the triangle is isosceles. This is because in an isosceles triangle, the altitude from the vertex angle to the base is equal to the length of the base, and the altitude from the base angles to the opposite sides are equal to the lengths of the legs of the triangle.\n\nGiven that two altitudes are not smaller than the sides on which they are dropped, it means that the triangle must be isosceles with two equal sides. This is because in a scalene triangle, all altitudes would be smaller than the sides on which they are dropped, as the altitude from the vertex angle to the base is greater than the length of the base.\n\nTherefore, the angles of the triangle must be such that it is isosceles. The angles of an isosceles triangle can be either 2 angles of 60 degrees and 1 angle of 120 degrees, or 2 angles of 72 degrees and 1 angle of 36 degrees.\n\nLet's consider the case where the triangle is isosceles with angles 60, 60, and 60 degrees.

Inside an equilateral triangle with side $a$, there are three equal circles, each of which touches two sides of the triangle and two other circles. Find the area of the part of the triangle that is outside these circles.\nassistant\n<think>\nTo find the area of the part of the triangle that is outside the circles, we first need to determine the radius of the circles and then calculate the area of the triangle and the circles.\n</think>\n<answer>\nLet's start by finding the radius of the circles. Since the circles touch two sides of the triangle and two other circles, we can see that the radius of each circle is equal to the distance from the center of the circle to the side of the triangle. This distance is also equal to the height of the equilateral triangle minus the radius of the circle.\n\nThe height of an equilateral triangle with side length $a$ is given by $h = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}a$. The radius of each circle is then $r = \\frac{h}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}a$.\n\nNow, let's calculate the area of the triangle and the circles. The area of the equilateral triangle is given by $A_{\\triangle} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}a^2$. The area of each circle is given by $A_{\\text{circle}} = \\pi r^2 = \\pi \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}a\\right)^2 = \\frac{3\\pi}{16}a^2$.\n\nSince there are three circles, the total area of the circles is $3A_{\\text{circle}} = \\frac{9\\pi}{16}a^2$.\n\nThe area of the part of the triangle that is outside the circles is then $A_{\\text{outside}} = A_{\\triangle} - 3A_{\\text{circle}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}a^2 - \\frac{9\\pi}{16}a^2 = a^2\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} - \\frac{9\\pi}{16}\\right)$.\n</answer>", "450_correct": false, "450_changed": false}

Let's also denote the number of mushrooms each child has as \\( m \\).\n\nFrom the problem, we know that if Anya gives half of her mushrooms to Vitya, all the children will have the same number of mushrooms. This means that after giving half of her mushrooms to Vitya, Anya will have \\( \\frac{A}{2} \\) mushrooms left, and each child will have \\( m + \\frac{A}{2n} \\) mushrooms. Since this is the same for all children, we can write:\n\\[ m + \\frac{A}{2n} = m \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ \\frac{A}{2n} = 0 \\]\nThis implies that \\( A = 0 \\), which is not possible since Anya has mushrooms. Instead, we need to consider the second condition.\n\nIf Anya gives all her mushrooms to Sasha, Sasha will have as many mushrooms as all the others combined. This means that after giving all her mushrooms to Sasha, Anya will have \\( A - m \\) mushrooms left, and Sasha will have \\( A \\) mushrooms. The remaining \\( n-1 \\) children will have \\( m \\) mushrooms each. Since Sasha will have as many mushrooms as all the others combined, we can write:\n\\[ A = (n-1)m + m \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ A = nm \\]\nSince \\( A = 0 \\) is not possible, we need to consider the possibility that the total number of mushrooms is such that when Anya gives half to Vitya, the remaining mushrooms are evenly distributed among the children, and when she gives all to Sasha, Sasha ends up with as many mushrooms as the others combined.\n\nLet's assume the total number of mushrooms is \\( T \\).

This form is derived from the general equation of a hyperbola, $Ax^2 + By^2 = 1$, where $A = B$ for an equilateral hyperbola.\n\nGiven that the hyperbola passes through the point $M(4, -2)$, we can substitute these coordinates into the equation to find the value of $c^2$.\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\\[4 \\cdot (-2) = c^2\\]\n\\[c^2 = -8\\]\n\nSince $c^2$ cannot be negative, we need to consider the correct form of the hyperbola equation. The correct form for an equilateral hyperbola with foci on the $O x$ axis is $xy = c^2$, but we must ensure that $c^2$ is positive. This implies that the hyperbola is oriented in a way that its asymptotes are at a 45-degree angle to the coordinate axes, which is not the case for an equilateral hyperbola. Therefore, we need to consider the correct orientation and the fact that the hyperbola is not equilateral but rather a rectangular hyperbola.\n\nThe correct form for a rectangular hyperbola with foci on the $O x$ axis is $x^2 - y^2 = c^2$. Substituting the point $M(4, -2)$ into this equation, we get:\n\\[4^2 - (-2)^2 = c^2\\]\n\\[16 - 4 = c^2\\]\n\\[c^2 = 12\\]\n\nThus, the equation of the hyperbola is:\n\\[x^2 - y^2 = 12\\]\n</think>\n<answer>\n\\[x^2 - y^2 = 12\\]\n</answer>", "450_correct": true, "450_changed": true}

The equation becomes:\n\\[ f(1 + f(y)) = f(1) + y. \\]\n\nThis tells us that \\( f \\) is surjective because for any \\( y \\in \\mathbf{N}^{*} \\), there exists some \\( z = 1 + f(y) \\) such that \\( f(z) = f(1) + y \\). Therefore, \\( f \\) maps every natural number to a natural number.\n\nNext, let's consider the injectivity of \\( f \\). Suppose \\( f(a) = f(b) \\). Then, for any \\( x \\in \\mathbf{N}^{*} \\), we have:\n\\[ f(x + f(a)) = f(x) + a \\]\nand\n\\[ f(x + f(b)) = f(x) + b. \\]\nSince \\( f(a) = f(b) \\), it follows that:\n\\[ f(x + f(a)) = f(x + f(b)). \\]\nThis implies that \\( f \\) is injective.\n\nSince \\( f \\) is both surjective and injective, it is bijective. Therefore, there exists a unique \\( c \\in \\mathbf{N}^{*} \\) such that \\( f(c) = 1 \\).\n\nNow, let's substitute \\( y = c \\) into the original equation:\n\\[ f(x + f(c)) = f(x) + c. \\]\nSince \\( f(c) = 1 \\), this simplifies to:\n\\[ f(x + 1) = f(x) + c. \\]\nThis shows that \\( f \\) is a linear function with slope \\( c \\).\n\nTo find the specific form of \\( f \\), we can use the fact that \\( f \\) is bijective. Since \\( f \\) is surjective and injective, it must be a bijection. The only bijective function from \\( \\mathbf{N}^{*} \\) to \\( \\mathbf{N}^{*} \\) that is linear with slope \\( c \\) is \\( f(x) = cx \\).\n\nWe need to check if this function satisfies the original equation. Substituting \\( f(x) = cx \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ f(x + f(y)) = f(x + cy) = c(x + cy) = cx + c^2 y, \\]\nand\n\\[ f(x) + y = cx + y. \\]\nFor these to be equal for all \\( x, y \\in \\mathbf{N}^{*} \\), we must have \\( c^2 = 1 \\). Therefore, \\( c = 1 \\) or \\( c = -1 \\). Since \\( f: \\mathbf{N}^{*} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{N}^{*} \\), \\( c \\) must be positive, so \\( c = 1 \\).\n\nThus, the only function that satisfies the given condition is:\n\\[ f(x) = x. \\]\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\\[ \\boxed{f(x) = x}. \\]\n</think>\n<answer>\n\\[ \\boxed{f(x) = x} \\]\n</answer>", "450_correct": true, "450_changed": true}

This configuration implies that the cube is oriented such that its edges are parallel to the edges of the pyramid.\n\nThe lateral edge of the pyramid makes an angle $\\alpha$ with the base plane. This angle helps us understand the spatial relationship between the pyramid and the cube.\n\nTo find the ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the pyramid, we need to consider the height of the pyramid and the side length of the cube. The height of the pyramid can be related to the angle $\\alpha$ and the side length of the cube.\n\nLet's denote the side length of the cube as $s$ and the height of the pyramid as $h$. The volume of the cube is $V_{\\text{cube}} = s^3$.\n\nThe volume of the pyramid is $V_{\\text{pyramid}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{Base Area} \\times \\text{Height} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times s^2 \\times h$.\n\nThe ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the pyramid is:\n\\[\n\\frac{V_{\\text{cube}}}{V_{\\text{pyramid}}} = \\frac{s^3}{\\frac{1}{3} s^2 h} = \\frac{3s}{h}\n\\]\n\nTo find $h$ in terms of $s$ and $\\alpha$, we use the relationship between the height of the pyramid and the angle $\\alpha$. The height $h$ can be expressed as:\n\\[\nh = \\frac{s}{\\cos \\alpha}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting this into the ratio, we get:\n\\[\n\\frac{V_{\\text{cube}}}{V_{\\text{pyramid}}} = \\frac{3s}{\\frac{s}{\\cos \\alpha}} = 3 \\cos \\alpha\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the pyramid is $3 \\cos \\alpha$.\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the pyramid is $3 \\cos \\alpha$.\n</answer>", "450_correct": false, "450_changed": false}

Let's denote the roots of $P(x)$ by $r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_m$. When we substitute $x^2$ for $x$ in $P(x)$, we get $P(x^2)$. The roots of $P(x^2)$ are the values of $x$ such that $x^2 = r_i$ for some root $r_i$ of $P(x)$. This means that each root $r_i$ of $P(x)$ contributes two roots to $P(x^2)$, except for the case where $r_i = 0$ (which would contribute only one root to $P(x^2)$).\n\nSince $P(x^2)$ has $2n+1$ roots, and each root of $P(x)$ contributes at least two roots to $P(x^2)$, we can deduce that $P(x)$ must have at least $2n+1$ roots.

This implies that $S_k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{k}$.\n\nLet's analyze the sequence step by step:\n1. $a_1 = 2021^{2021}$\n2. For $k=2$, $S_2 = a_1 - a_2 = 2021^{2021} - a_2$. Since $0 \\le a_2 < 2$, we have $2021^{2021} - a_2$ is a multiple of 2. This means $a_2$ must be odd.\n3. For $k=3$, $S_3 = a_1 - a_2 + a_3 = 2021^{2021} - a_2 + a_3$. Since $0 \\le a_3 < 3$, we have $2021^{2021} - a_2 + a_3$ is a multiple of 3. This means $a_3$ must be congruent to $a_2 \\pmod{3}$.\n4. For $k=4$, $S_4 = a_1 - a_2 + a_3 - a_4 = 2021^{2021} - a_2 + a_3 - a_4$. Since $0 \\le a_4 < 4$, we have $2021^{2021} - a_2 + a_3 - a_4$ is a multiple of 4. This means $a_4$ must be congruent to $a_2 \\pmod{4}$.\n\nBy continuing this pattern, we can see that $a_n$ must be congruent to $a_2 \\pmod{n}$ for all $n$. Since $a_2$ is odd, $a_n$ must be odd for all $n$.\n\nNow, let's consider the sum $S_{2021}$. Since $S_{2021} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2021}$, and $2021$ is odd, $S_{2021}$ must be even. This means that the sum of the first 2021 terms of the sequence must be even.\n\nGiven that $a_1 = 2021^{2021}$ is odd, and the sum of the first 2021 terms must be even, it follows that $a_2$ must be even. This is because the sum of an odd number of odd terms is odd, and the sum of an even number of odd terms is even.\n\nSince $a_2$ is even, and $a_2$ must be congruent to $a_1 \\pmod{2}$, we have $a_2 = 2021^{2021} \\pmod{2}$. Since $2021 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$, we have $2021^{2021} \\equiv 1^{2021} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$. Therefore, $a_2 = 1$.\n\nNow, we need to find $a_{2021^{2022}}$. Since $a_n$ is odd for all $n$, and $a_2 = 1$, it follows that $a_{2021^{2022}}$ must be odd.

The median is the middle value when the weights are arranged in ascending order. Arranging the weights in ascending order, we get 5, 5, 6, 8, 106. The middle value is 6 pounds. So, the median weight is 6 pounds.\n\nComparing the mean and the median, we see that the mean (26 pounds) is larger than the median (6 pounds). The difference between the mean and the median is 26 - 6 = 20 pounds.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (E) Mean, 20.\n</answer>", "450_correct": true, "450_changed": false}

The sum of the ages of the mother, father, and the two youngest daughters is 88 years.\n2. The sum of the ages of the two youngest daughters and the mother is 31 years less than the age of the father.\n3. The father's age is the sum of the mother's age and the age of one of the daughters.\n\nLet's denote the ages of the daughters as \\(x\\), \\(x+2\\), and \\(x+4\\). The ages of the mother and father are \\(m\\) and \\(t\\) respectively.\n\nFrom the first relationship, we have:\n\\[ t + m + x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) = 88 \\]\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[ t + m + 3x + 6 = 88 \\]\n\\[ t + m + 3x = 82 \\]\n\nFrom the second relationship, we have:\n\\[ t + m + x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) = 88 \\]\n\\[ t + m + 3x + 6 = 88 \\]\n\\[ t + m + 3x = 82 \\]\n\nFrom the third relationship, we have:\n\\[ t = m + x \\]\n\nNow, we can substitute \\(t = m + x\\) into the first equation:\n\\[ (m + x) + m + 3x = 82 \\]\n\\[ 2m + 4x = 82 \\]\n\\[ m + 2x = 41 \\]\n\\[ m = 41 - 2x \\]\n\nNow we have expressions for \\(m\\) and \\(t\\) in terms of \\(x\\). We can substitute these into the second equation:\n\\[ (41 - 2x) + 2x + 3x = 82 \\]\n\\[ 41 + 3x = 82 \\]\n\\[ 3x = 41 \\]\n\\[ x = 5 \\]\n\nSo, the age of the youngest daughter is 5 years.

Since \\(p, q, r\\) are primes, they can either be odd or even. If any of them were even, the product \\((p+1)(q+2)(r+3)\\) would be even, but the right-hand side \\(4pqr\\) is even, so this would imply that at least one of \\(p, q, r\\) is even, which is not possible since all primes are odd. Therefore, all three primes must be odd.\n\nNext, let's consider the equation modulo 3. Since all primes are either 1 or 2 modulo 3, we have:\n- If \\(p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\\), then \\(p+1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}\\).\n- If \\(p \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}\\), then \\(p+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}\\).\n\nSimilarly, for \\(q\\) and \\(r\\):\n- If \\(q \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\\), then \\(q+2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}\\).\n- If \\(q \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}\\), then \\(q+2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\\).\n- If \\(r \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\\), then \\(r+3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}\\).\n- If \\(r \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}\\), then \\(r+3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\\).\n\nNow, let's test some small odd primes to see if we can find a solution.

The orthocenter of an equilateral triangle is also its centroid, circumcenter, and incenter, which means it is the same point.\n\n2. **Orthocenters R and S**: The orthocenter of a triangle is the point where the altitudes intersect.

The key is to understand that the angle BCQ must be such that the triangle RST is equilateral.\n\n5. **Possible Values for Angle BCQ**: For RST to be equilateral, the angle BCQ must be 60 degrees.

However, since $U$ and $T$ are different letters, we can eliminate $(1, 15)$ and $(15, 1)$, leaving us with $(3, 5)$ and $(5, 3)$.\n\nLet's consider the pair $(3, 5)$ for $(U, T)$. This means $U=3$ and $T=5$.\n\nNow, let's use condition (4): $S \\times L=8$. The possible pairs for $(S, L)$ are $(1, 8)$, $(2, 4)$, $(4, 2)$, and $(8, 1)$. Since $S$ and $L$ are different letters, we can eliminate $(1, 8)$ and $(8, 1)$, leaving us with $(2, 4)$ and $(4, 2)$.\n\nLet's consider the pair $(2, 4)$ for $(S, L)$. This means $S=2$ and $L=4$.\n\nNow, we have $E+U+L=6$, and we know $U=3$ and $L=4$. So, $E+3+4=6$, which means $E= -1$, which is not possible since $E$ must be a positive integer. Therefore, we must have $U=5$ and $L=3$.\n\nNow, we have $S+R+U+T=18$, and we know $S=2$ and $U=5$. So, $2+R+5+T=18$, which means $R+T=11$. Since $R$ and $T$ are different letters, we can try the pairs $(R, T)$ that add up to 11. The only pair that fits is $(R, T) = (6, 5)$ or $(5, 6)$. Since $T=5$, we must have $R=6$.\n\nNow, we have $S \\times L=8$, and we know $S=2$ and $L=4$. This condition is already satisfied.\n\nSo, the values of $E, U, L, S, R, T$ are $E=1$, $U=5$, $L=3$, $S=2$, $R=6$, and $T=4$.\n\nThe six-digit number $\\overline{E U L S R T} = 153264$.\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe six-digit number $\\overline{E U L S R T} = 153264$.\n</answer>", "450_correct": false, "450_changed": false}

Let's denote the length of the segment \\(O_1O_2\\) as \\(d\\). The larger circle has a radius of 6 cm, and the smaller circle has a radius of 4 cm.

Determine the smallest positive integer $k$ with the following property: it is possible to mark $k$ cells on a $2 n \\times 2 n$ board so that there exists a unique partition of the board into $1 \\times 2$ and $2 \\times 1$ dominoes, none of which contains two marked cells.\nassistant\n<think>\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand the constraints and the nature of the dominoes that can be placed on the board. A $1 \\times 2$ domino covers two adjacent cells, and a $2 \\times 1$ domino covers two cells that are not adjacent. The key is to ensure that the marked cells do not form any pairs that would allow for multiple valid partitions of the board.\n\nFirst, let's consider the total number of cells on the board, which is $4n^2$. Since each domino covers 2 cells, the maximum number of dominoes that can be placed is $2n^2$. However, we need to ensure that the marked cells do not form any pairs that would allow for multiple valid partitions.\n\nTo achieve this, we can use a checkerboard coloring argument. Color the cells of the board in a checkerboard pattern, where each cell is either black or white. In a $2n \\times 2n$ board, there will be $n^2$ black cells and $n^2$ white cells. If we mark $k$ cells such that $k$ is odd, then we will have an equal number of black and white cells among the marked cells. This is because the total number of marked cells is $k$, and if $k$ is odd, then $k/2$ is an integer, meaning that half of the marked cells will be black and the other half will be white.\n\nNow, let's consider the dominoes. If we place a $1 \\times 2$ domino on a black cell, it will cover two black cells. Similarly, if we place a $2 \\times 1$ domino on a white cell, it will cover two white cells. Since we have an equal number of black and white cells among the marked cells, it is impossible to place a $1 \\times 2$ domino on a black cell and a $2 \\times 1$ domino on a white cell without having two marked cells in the same domino. This is because the $1 \\times 2$ domino covers two black cells, and the $2 \\times 1$ domino covers two white cells, and we cannot have two marked cells in the same domino.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $k$ that satisfies the condition is $k = 2n^2$. This is because if $k = 2n^2$, then we can mark all the cells of one color (either all black or all white) without having any marked cells in the same domino.\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe smallest positive integer $k$ with the given property is $2n^2$.\n</answer>", "450_correct": false, "450_changed": false}

A table of values of a known function $f(n)$ for natural values of $n$ has been compiled; it turned out that the second difference is constantly equal to zero. By what formula can $f(n)$ be represented for any natural $n$? How does the situation stand for fractional values of $n$?\nassistant\n<think>\nTo determine the formula for $f(n)$, we need to understand the properties of the function given that the second difference is constant. The second difference being constant implies that the function is a quadratic function. A quadratic function can be represented in the form $f(n) = an^2 + bn + c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants.\n\nFor natural values of $n$, the situation is straightforward. We can directly substitute the values of $n$ into the quadratic formula to find the values of $f(n)$.\n\nFor fractional values of $n$, the situation is more complex. Quadratic functions are not defined for fractional values of $n$ because they involve squaring the variable. Therefore, the function $f(n)$ cannot be represented in a simple closed form for fractional values of $n$.\n\nTo summarize:\n- For natural values of $n$, the function $f(n)$ can be represented as $f(n) = an^2 + bn + c$.\n- For fractional values of $n$, the function $f(n)$ cannot be represented in a simple closed form.\n</think>\n<answer>\n- For natural values of $n$, the function $f(n)$ can be represented as $f(n) = an^2 + bn + c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants.\n- For fractional values of $n$, the function $f(n)$ cannot be represented in a simple closed form.\n</answer>", "450_correct": false, "450_changed": false}
