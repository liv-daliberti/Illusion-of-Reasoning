Let's start by examining the sequence and its initial conditions.\n\nThe sequence is defined as follows:\n- $a_1 = 1$\n- $a_{2n} = a_n$\n- $a_{2n+1} = a_n + 1$\n\nWe need to find all positive integers $n$ such that $a_{kn} = a_n$ for all integers $1 \\leq k \\leq n$.\n\nTo approach this, let's consider the properties of the sequence and how it evolves. We can start by calculating the first few terms to see if we can identify a pattern.\n\n1. $a_1 = 1$\n2. $a_2 = a_1 = 1$\n3. $a_3 = a_1 + 1 = 2$\n4. $a_4 = a_2 = 1$\n5. $a_5 = a_2 + 1 = 2$\n6. $a_6 = a_3 = 2$\n7. $a_7 = a_3 + 1 = 3$\n8. $a_8 = a_4 = 1$\n9. $a_9 = a_4 + 1 = 2$\n10. $a_{10} = a_5 = 2$\n\nFrom these calculations, we can see that the sequence alternates between values of 1 and 2. Specifically, $a_{2n} = 1$ and $a_{2n+1} = 2$ for all $n \\geq 1$.\n\nNow, let's consider the condition $a_{kn} = a_n$ for all integers $1 \\leq k \\leq n$. This means that the value of $a_n$ must be the same for all multiples of $n$. From the pattern we observed, we can see that this condition is only satisfied if $n$ is a power of 2. This is because the sequence alternates between 1 and 2, and the only way for $a_{kn} = a_n$ for all $1 \\leq k \\leq n$ is if $n$ is a power of 2.\n\nTherefore, the positive integers $n$ that satisfy the condition are the powers of 2.\n\nb) To prove that there exist infinitely many positive integers $m$ such that $a_{km} \\geq a_m$ for all positive integers $k$, we need to consider the properties of the sequence and how it evolves.\n\nFrom the pattern we observed, we can see that the sequence alternates between values of 1 and 2. Specifically, $a_{2n} = 1$ and $a_{2n+1} = 2$ for all $n \\geq 1$. This means that for any positive integer $m$, there exists a positive integer $k$ such that $km = 2m$ and $a_{2m} = 1$. Therefore, $a_{km} = 1 \\geq a_m$ for all positive integers $k$.\n\nSince there are infinitely many positive integers $m$, and for each $m$ there exists a positive integer $k$ such that $a_{km} \\geq a_m$, we can conclude that there exist infinitely many positive integers $m$ such that $a_{km} \\geq a_m$ for all positive integers $k$.\n\nTherefore, the answer to part b) is that there exist infinitely many positive integers $m$ such that $a_{km} \\geq a_m$ for all positive integers $k$.\n</think>\n<answer>\na) The positive integers $n$ that satisfy the condition are the powers of 2.\nb) There exist infinitely many positive integers $m$ such that $a_{km} \\geq a_m$ for all positive integers $k$.\n</answer>", "900_correct": false, "900_changed": false}

Let's denote the trapezoid as ABCD with AB = 3 cm, CD = 5 cm, and diagonals AC and BD intersecting at point E. We know that one of the diagonals, BD = 8 cm, and the angle between the diagonals is 60°.\n\nFirst, we need to find the length of the other diagonal, AC. We can use the Law of Cosines in triangle ABD:\n\\[ BD^2 = AB^2 + AD^2 - 2 \\cdot AB \\cdot AD \\cdot \\cos(\\angle BAD) \\]\nSince we don't know the length of AD, we need to find it first.

Find the angles of the triangle.\nassistant\n<think>\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the altitudes and the sides of a triangle. The key insight is that if two altitudes are not smaller than the sides on which they are dropped, it implies that the triangle is isosceles. This is because in an isosceles triangle, the altitude from the vertex angle to the base is equal to the length of the base, and the altitude from the base angles to the opposite sides are equal to the lengths of the legs of the triangle.\n\nGiven that two altitudes are not smaller than the sides on which they are dropped, it means that the triangle must be isosceles with two equal sides. Let's denote the angles of the triangle as \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\), where \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are the base angles and \\(C\\) is the vertex angle.\n\nSince the triangle is isosceles, we have \\(A = B\\).

Let's start by understanding the relationship between the cube and the pyramid.\n\nGiven that the cube is inscribed in the pyramid, the vertices of the cube's upper base lie on the lateral edges of the pyramid, and the vertices of the cube's lower base are in the plane of the pyramid's base. This configuration implies that the cube is oriented such that its edges are parallel to the edges of the pyramid.\n\nThe key to solving this problem is to recognize that the height of the pyramid and the side length of the cube are related through the angle \\(\\alpha\\) that the lateral edge makes with the base plane. Let's denote the side length of the cube by \\(a\\) and the height of the pyramid by \\(h\\).\n\nThe lateral edge of the pyramid forms a right triangle with the height of the pyramid and the side length of the cube.

Since \\(DK\\) is the height, we have \\(DK = h\\).\n\nNext, since \\(K\\) and \\(M\\) are the midpoints of \\(AB\\) and \\(CD\\) respectively, the length of \\(KM\\) is half the difference of the lengths of the bases:\n\\[ KM = \\frac{AB - CD}{2} = \\frac{5 - 3}{2} = 1. \\]\n\nNow, consider triangle \\(AMB\\).

The sequence starts as $1, 2, 3, \\cdots$ and we remove all perfect squares. So, the sequence becomes $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, \\cdots$.\n\nThe perfect squares in this sequence are $1, 4, 9, 16, 25, \\cdots$. We need to find the 2003rd term of the sequence after removing the perfect squares.\n\nTo do this, we need to find the position of the 2003rd term in the original sequence of positive integers. The number of perfect squares up to $n$ is $\\lfloor \\sqrt{n} \\rfloor$. So, we need to find the largest $n$ such that $\\lfloor \\sqrt{n} \\rfloor \\leq 2003$.\n\nLet's denote $n = k^2$. Then, we need to find the largest $k$ such that $k^2 \\leq 2003$. We can calculate this as follows:\n\n$k^2 \\leq 2003 \\implies k \\leq \\sqrt{2003} \\approx 44.75$\n\nSo, the largest integer $k$ is 44. This means that the 2003rd term in the original sequence is $44^2 = 1936$. However, we need to find the 2003rd term in the sequence after removing the perfect squares. This means we need to find the 2003rd term in the sequence of positive integers minus the number of perfect squares up to 44.\n\nThe number of perfect squares up to 44 is 44. So, the 2003rd term in the sequence of positive integers is $2003 + 44 = 2047$.\n\nTherefore, the 2003rd term of the sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ is 2047.\n</think>\n<answer>\n(B) 2047\n</answer>", "900_correct": false, "900_changed": false}

Let's denote the sum of the first $k$ terms as $S_k = a_1 - a_2 + a_3 - a_4 + \\cdots + (-1)^{k+1}a_k$. We know that $S_k$ is a multiple of $k$ for all $k$.\n\nTo find $a_{2021^{2022}}$, we need to understand the pattern of the sequence.

This suggests that the sequence might be periodic in a certain way.\n\nTo find $a_{2021^{2022}}$, we need to determine the position of $2021^{2022}$ in the sequence. Since the sequence alternates and the sum of the first $k$ terms is a multiple of $k$, we can infer that the sequence might have a repeating pattern.\n\nGiven the complexity of the problem, we can use the fact that the sequence is periodic to find the value of $a_{2021^{2022}}$. Since the sequence alternates and the sum of the first $k$ terms is a multiple of $k$, we can conclude that the value of $a_{2021^{2022}}$ is the same as the value of $a_1$, which is $2021^{2021}$.\n\nTherefore, the $2021^{2022}$th term of the sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ is $2021^{2021}$.\n</think>\n<answer>\n$2021^{2021}$\n</answer>", "900_correct": false, "900_changed": false}

This assumption is valid because if \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) share a common divisor \\(z\\), then \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must also share a common divisor \\(z\\), which contradicts the assumption that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are coprime.\n\nSubstituting \\(x = az\\) and \\(y = bz\\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[az + (bz)^2 + z^3 = (az)(bz)z\\]\n\\[az + b^2z^2 + z^3 = abz^3\\]\n\\[z(a + b^2z + z^2) = abz^3\\]\n\nSince \\(z \\neq 0\\), we can divide both sides by \\(z\\):\n\\[a + b^2z + z^2 = abz^2\\]\n\nRearranging terms, we get:\n\\[a + b^2z + z^2 - abz^2 = 0\\]\n\nThis equation must hold for all positive integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) that are coprime. Let's analyze this equation for small values of \\(z\\).\n\n1. **Case \\(z = 1\\):**\n   \\[a + b^2 + 1 = ab\\]\n   This equation must hold for all coprime \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Let's test some small values:\n   - If \\(a = 2\\) and \\(b = 1\\), then \\(2 + 1^2 + 1 = 2 \\cdot 1\\) is true.\n   - If \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = 1\\), then \\(3 + 1^2 + 1 = 3 \\cdot 1\\) is true.\n   - If \\(a = 2\\) and \\(b = 2\\), then \\(2 + 2^2 + 1 = 2 \\cdot 2^2\\) is false.\n\n   Therefore, \\(z = 1\\) is a solution.\n\n2. **Case \\(z > 1\\):**\n   For \\(z > 1\\), the term \\(b^2z\\) and \\(abz^2\\) will grow faster than the linear term \\(a + b^2 + z^2\\), making it impossible for the equation to hold for all coprime \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nThus, the only solution is \\(z = 1\\).\n\nTherefore, the only positive integers \\(x, y\\) that satisfy the equation \\(x + y^2 + z^3 = xyz\\) with \\(z\\) being the greatest common divisor of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are \\(x = 2\\) and \\(y = 1\\) (or vice versa).\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{2, 1}\\).\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe only positive integers \\(x, y\\) that satisfy the equation \\(x + y^2 + z^3 = xyz\\) with \\(z\\) being the greatest common divisor of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are \\(x = 2\\) and \\(y = 1\\) (or vice versa).

Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: Marco starts by choosing a black cell with more than two white neighbors and turning it white. This cell and its neighbors become white. Vera then swaps the colors of two neighboring cells.\n\n2. **Objective**: Vera's goal is to ensure that Marco cannot choose a black cell with more than two white neighbors. This means Vera needs to prevent Marco from making such a move.\n\n3. **Strategy for Vera**: Vera can use the fact that she can swap the colors of two neighboring cells. If she can ensure that no two neighboring cells are the same color, then Marco will not be able to make a move that changes the number of white neighbors of a black cell.\n\n4. **Minimum Value of \\( k \\)**: We need to find the minimum value of \\( k \\) such that Vera can guarantee a win. This means Vera needs to ensure that Marco cannot make a move that changes the number of white neighbors of a black cell.\n\n5. **Turns and Swaps**: Vera can perform \\( k \\) turns, each of which involves swapping the colors of two neighboring cells. If Vera can ensure that no two neighboring cells are the same color after \\( k \\) turns, then Marco will not be able to make a move that changes the number of white neighbors of a black cell.\n\n6. **Smallest \\( k \\)**: The smallest \\( k \\) that Vera can use to guarantee a win is \\( k = 3 \\). This is because after 3 turns, Vera can ensure that no two neighboring cells are the same color. This is because in a 3x3 grid, it is always possible to swap the colors of two neighboring cells in such a way that no two neighboring cells are the same color.\n\n7. **Smallest \\( t \\)**: For \\( k = 3 \\), the smallest \\( t \\) such that Vera can guarantee a win after at most \\( t \\) turns is \\( t = 1 \\). This is because after 1 turn, Vera can ensure that no two neighboring cells are the same color.\n\n8. **Final Calculation**: We need to compute \\( 100m + t \\). Here, \\( m = 3 \\) and \\( t = 1 \\). Therefore, \\( 100m + t = 100 \\cdot 3 + 1 = 301 \\).\n\nThe final answer is \\( \\boxed{301} \\).\n</answer>", "900_correct": false, "900_changed": false}

Therefore, $BC$ is the height of the trapezoid.\n\nFirst, we need to find the length of $AD$. Since $ABCD$ is a trapezoid with right angles at $BAD$ and $ADC$, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find $AD$.\n\nLet's denote the length of $AD$ as $x$.

We are given that RST is equilateral, and we need to find the possible values of angle BCQ.\n</think>\n<answer>\nLet's start by considering the properties of the equilateral triangle ABC. Since ABC is equilateral, all its internal angles are 60 degrees. The points M and N are midpoints of AC and AB, respectively, so they divide the sides into two equal segments.\nNow, let's consider the orthocenters R and S. The orthocenter of a triangle is the point where the altitudes intersect. In an equilateral triangle, the altitudes are also the angle bisectors and the medians. Therefore, R and S are the same point, which is the centroid of the triangle.\nSince RST is equilateral, the angles at R, S, and T must be 60 degrees. This means that the lines BP and CQ must intersect at a point that forms a 60-degree angle with the sides of the triangle.\nNow, let's consider the angle BCQ. Since ABC is equilateral, angle BAC is 60 degrees. Therefore, angle BCQ must be 60 degrees as well, because the angles in an equilateral triangle are all equal.\nTherefore, the only possible value for angle BCQ is 60 degrees.\n</answer>", "900_correct": false, "900_changed": false}

For the first term, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a\\left(b^{2}+1\\right)}{a+b} = \\frac{a b^{2} + a}{a+b} = \\frac{a b^{2}}{a+b} + \\frac{a}{a+b}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, for the second and third terms, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b\\left(c^{2}+1\\right)}{b+c} = \\frac{b c^{2}}{b+c} + \\frac{b}{b+c}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{c\\left(a^{2}+1\\right)}{c+a} = \\frac{c a^{2}}{c+a} + \\frac{c}{c+a}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's consider the constraint \\(a b + b c + c a = 1\\). We can use this to simplify the expression further. Notice that if we set \\(a = b = c\\), then the constraint is satisfied, and we can substitute \\(a = b = c\\) into the expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a\\left(b^{2}+1\\right)}{a+b}+\\frac{b\\left(c^{2}+1\\right)}{b+c}+\\frac{c\\left(a^{2}+1\\right)}{c+a} = \\frac{a\\left(a^{2}+1\\right)}{a+a} + \\frac{a\\left(a^{2}+1\\right)}{a+a} + \\frac{a\\left(a^{2}+1\\right)}{a+a} = \\frac{a\\left(a^{2}+1\\right)}{2a} + \\frac{a\\left(a^{2}+1\\right)}{2a} + \\frac{a\\left(a^{2}+1\\right)}{2a} = \\frac{a^{3}+a}{2} + \\frac{a^{3}+a}{2} + \\frac{a^{3}+a}{2} = \\frac{3a^{3}+3a}{2} = \\frac{3a(a^2+1)}{2}\n\\]\n\nSince \\(a b + b c + c a = 1\\), we can use the AM-GM inequality to find the maximum value of \\(a\\). The AM-GM inequality states that for positive real numbers \\(a, b, c\\), we have:\n\n\\[\na + b + c \\geq 3\\sqrt[3]{abc}\n\\]\n\nGiven \\(a b + b c + c a = 1\\), we can use the fact that the equality holds when \\(a = b = c\\).
