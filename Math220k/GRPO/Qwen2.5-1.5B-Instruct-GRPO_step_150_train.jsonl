Let's denote the roots of the equation by $r-d$, $r$, and $r+d$, where $r$ is the middle term and $d$ is the common difference of the arithmetic sequence.\n\nGiven that the roots form an arithmetic sequence, we can express the polynomial equation in terms of its roots.

The coefficient of $x^2$ gives us $3r^2 + d^2 = -3$.\n2. The coefficient of $x$ gives us $-r^3 - d^3 = -1$.\n3.

All 3 reds are drawn before both green chips are drawn:\n   - The first red chip can be drawn in 3 ways (since there are 3 red chips).\n   - The second red chip can be drawn in 2 ways (since one red chip has already been drawn).\n   - The third red chip can be drawn in 1 way (since two red chips have already been drawn).\n   - The remaining 2 chips must be green, and there are 2 ways to choose which 2 out of the 2 green chips are drawn.\n   - The total number of ways to draw the chips in this scenario is $3 \\times 2 \\times 1 \\times 2 = 12$.\n\n2. Both green chips are drawn before all 3 reds are drawn:\n   - The first green chip can be drawn in 2 ways (since there are 2 green chips).\n   - The second green chip can be drawn in 1 way (since one green chip has already been drawn).\n   - The remaining 3 chips must be red, and there is only 1 way to choose which 3 out of the 3 red chips are drawn.\n   - The total number of ways to draw the chips in this scenario is $2 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 2$.\n\nThe total number of ways to draw the chips is the sum of the number of ways in both scenarios, which is $12 + 2 = 14$.\n\nThe probability that the 3 reds are drawn is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes, which is $\\frac{14}{14 + 12} = \\frac{14}{26} = \\frac{7}{13}$.\n\nHowever, this is not one of the given options. Let's re-evaluate the problem.\n\nThe correct approach is to consider the total number of ways to draw the chips and the number of ways to draw the chips in the scenario where all 3 reds are drawn before both green chips are drawn.\n\nThe total number of ways to draw the chips is the sum of the number of ways in both scenarios, which is $12 + 2 = 14$.\n\nThe number of ways to draw the chips in the scenario where all 3 reds are drawn before both green chips are drawn is $12$.\n\nThe probability that the 3 reds are drawn is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes, which is $\\frac{12}{14} = \\frac{6}{7}$.\n\nHowever, this is still not one of the given options.

Let S be the set of 2 x 2 matrices over F with trace 1 and determinant 0. Find |S|.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Trace Condition:**\n   The trace of a matrix \\( A = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\) is given by \\( a + d \\). For the trace to be 1, we have:\n   \\[\n   a + d = 1\n   \\]\n\n2. **Understanding the Determinant Condition:**\n   The determinant of \\( A \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\det(A) = ad - bc = 0\n   \\]\n\n3. **Expressing the Determinant Condition:**\n   From the determinant condition, we can express \\( d \\) in terms of \\( a \\):\n   \\[\n   d = \\frac{bc}{a}\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( d = 1 - a \\) into the determinant condition, we get:\n   \\[\n   a(1 - a) - bc = 0 \\implies a - a^2 - bc = 0 \\implies bc = a - a^2\n   \\]\n\n4. **Counting the Matrices:**\n   We need to count the number of matrices \\( A \\) that satisfy both conditions. Let's consider the possible values for \\( a \\) and \\( d \\):\n   - \\( a \\) can be any element of \\( F \\), so there are \\( p \\) choices for \\( a \\).\n   - For each choice of \\( a \\), \\( d = 1 - a \\) is also a valid choice, so there are \\( p \\) choices for \\( d \\).\n\n   However, we need to ensure that \\( bc = a - a^2 \\) holds. This is a quadratic equation in \\( b \\) and \\( c \\), and it will have solutions for each \\( a \\) and \\( d \\).\n\n5. **Counting the Solutions:**\n   For each pair \\( (a, d) \\), the number of solutions for \\( b \\) and \\( c \\) is determined by the quadratic equation \\( bc = a - a^2 \\). This equation has exactly 2 solutions for \\( b \\) and \\( c \\) for each \\( a \\) and \\( d \\).\n\n   Therefore, for each of the \\( p \\) choices of \\( a \\) and \\( d \\), there are \\( 2p \\) solutions for \\( b \\) and \\( c \\).\n\n6. **Total Number of Matrices:**\n   Since there are \\( p \\) choices for \\( a \\) and \\( d \\), and for each pair there are \\( 2p \\) solutions for \\( b \\) and \\( c \\), the total number of matrices in \\( S \\) is:\n   \\[\n   |S| = p \\times 2p = 2p^2\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of matrices in \\( S \\) is \\( 2p^2 \\).\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe number of matrices in \\( S \\) is \\( 2p^2 \\).\n</answer>", "150_correct": false, "150_changed": false}

Let's start by understanding the relationship between the cube and the pyramid.\n\nGiven that the cube is inscribed in the pyramid, the vertices of the cube's upper base lie on the lateral edges of the pyramid, and the vertices of the cube's lower base are in the plane of the pyramid's base. This configuration implies that the cube is oriented such that its edges are parallel to the edges of the pyramid.\n\nThe lateral edge of the pyramid makes an angle $\\alpha$ with the base plane. This angle helps us determine the height of the pyramid and the side length of the cube.\n\nLet's denote the side length of the cube as $s$. The height of the pyramid can be expressed in terms of $s$ and $\\alpha$. The height of the pyramid can be found using trigonometry, specifically the sine of the angle $\\alpha$.\n\nThe height $h$ of the pyramid can be calculated as:\n\\[ h = s \\cdot \\sin(\\alpha) \\]\n\nThe volume $V_{\\text{cube}}$ of the cube is:\n\\[ V_{\\text{cube}} = s^3 \\]\n\nThe volume $V_{\\text{pyramid}}$ of the pyramid is:\n\\[ V_{\\text{pyramid}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\text{Base Area} \\cdot \\text{Height} \\]\n\nThe base area of the pyramid is the area of the square base, which is $s^2$.

On how many arrays is this possible?\nassistant\n<think>\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the properties of the operations and the constraints on the final array. The operations allow us to adjust the values in the array by subtracting 1 from each entry in a row or adding 1 to each entry in a column. The goal is to end up with an array where all entries are divisible by 2013.\n\nFirst, let's consider the effect of the operations on the divisibility by 2013. If we subtract 1 from each entry in a row, the sum of the entries in that row modulo 2013 will decrease by 2013. Similarly, if we add 1 to each entry in a column, the sum of the entries in that column modulo 2013 will increase by 2013.\n\nTo achieve an array where all entries are divisible by 2013, the sum of the entries in each row and each column modulo 2013 must be 0. This means that the total sum of all entries in the array modulo 2013 must be 0.\n\nNow, let's consider the initial sum of all entries in the array. Since each entry is between 1 and 2013, the sum of all entries in the array is between 2013 and 2013^2. The sum of all entries in the array modulo 2013 is between 0 and 2012. For the array to be transformed into an array where all entries are divisible by 2013, the initial sum of all entries in the array must be a multiple of 2013.\n\nThe number of possible arrays is determined by the number of ways to choose the initial values of the entries. Since each entry can be any integer between 1 and 2013, there are 2013 choices for each entry. Therefore, the total number of possible arrays is 2013^2013.\n\nHowever, we need to consider the operations allowed. The operations do not change the total sum of the entries in the array modulo 2013. Therefore, the initial sum of all entries in the array must be a multiple of 2013. This means that the number of possible arrays is 2013^(2013-1) = 2013^2012.\n\nTherefore, the number of arrays where all integers are divisible by 2013 is 2013^2012.\n</think>\n<answer>\n2013^2012\n</answer>", "150_correct": false, "150_changed": false}

The orthocenter of an equilateral triangle is also its centroid, circumcenter, and incenter, which means it is the same point.\n\n2. **Orthocenters R and S**: The orthocenter of a triangle is the point where the altitudes intersect.

The maximum number of planes of symmetry is achieved when the tetrahedron is symmetric in such a way that it can be divided into identical parts by planes passing through its center of symmetry.\n\nA tetrahedron has 12 rotational symmetries, which means it can be rotated in 12 different ways that map the tetrahedron onto itself. These rotations can be visualized as follows:\n1. Identity rotation (0 degrees)\n2. 120-degree rotations around axes through a vertex and the center of the opposite face\n3. 240-degree rotations around the same axes\n4. 180-degree rotations around axes through the midpoints of opposite edges\n\nEach of these rotations can be paired with another rotation that maps the tetrahedron onto itself in the opposite direction. This means that for each rotation, there is a corresponding reflection that also maps the tetrahedron onto itself. Therefore, the tetrahedron has 6 planes of symmetry, each corresponding to a pair of rotations.\n\nThus, the maximum number of planes of symmetry a tetrahedron can have is 6.\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe maximum number of planes of symmetry a tetrahedron can have is 6.\n</answer>", "150_correct": true, "150_changed": false}
