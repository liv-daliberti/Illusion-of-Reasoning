Since \\(AC\\) and \\(BD\\) are diagonals of the trapezoid, and the angle between them is \\(60^\\circ\\), we can use the Law of Cosines in triangle \\(ACO\\) and triangle \\(BDO\\).\n\nIn triangle \\(ACO\\), we have:\n\\[ AO^2 + CO^2 - 2 \\cdot AO \\cdot CO \\cdot \\cos(60^\\circ) = AC^2 \\]\nSince \\(AC = 8\\) cm and \\(\\cos(60^\\circ) = \\frac{1}{2}\\), we get:\n\\[ AO^2 + CO^2 - AO \\cdot CO = 64 \\]\n\nIn triangle \\(BDO\\), we have:\n\\[ BO^2 + DO^2 - 2 \\cdot BO \\cdot DO \\cdot \\cos(60^\\circ) = BD^2 \\]\nSince \\(BD = 8\\) cm and \\(\\cos(60^\\circ) = \\frac{1}{2}\\), we get:\n\\[ BO^2 + DO^2 - BO \\cdot DO = 64 \\]\n\nNow, let's denote \\(AO = x\\) and \\(CO = y\\).

The altitudes of a triangle are the perpendicular distances from each vertex to the opposite side.

Let's consider the properties of isosceles triangles and equilateral triangles first, as they often satisfy such conditions.\n\n1. **Isosceles Triangle**: If the triangle is isosceles, say \\( AB = AC \\), then \\( h_a \\geq a \\) and \\( h_b \\geq b \\) are satisfied. This is because the altitude from the vertex angle to the base is the same as the side opposite to the vertex angle, and the altitude from the base to the vertex is the same as the side opposite to the base.\n\n2. **Equilateral Triangle**: If the triangle is equilateral, all sides are equal, and all altitudes are equal. Therefore, \\( h_a = h_b = h_c \\geq a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\), which is always true for an equilateral triangle.\n\nNow, let's consider the general case where the triangle is not isosceles or equilateral.

This implies that the triangle must have specific angle properties.\n\n3. **General Triangle**: For a general triangle, if two altitudes are not smaller than the sides on which they are dropped, it suggests that the triangle is either right-angled or has specific angle properties that we need to explore further.\n\nGiven the problem's constraints, we can infer that the triangle must be a right-angled triangle. This is because in a right-angled triangle, the altitude from the right angle to the hypotenuse is equal to half the hypotenuse, and the other two altitudes are the legs of the triangle, which are smaller than the hypotenuse.\n\n4. **Right-Angled Triangle**: In a right-angled triangle, the angles are \\( 90^\\circ \\), \\( \\theta \\), and \\( 90^\\circ - \\theta \\).

Inside an equilateral triangle with side $a$, there are three equal circles, each of which touches two sides of the triangle and two other circles. Find the area of the part of the triangle that is outside these circles.\nassistant\n<think>\nTo find the area of the part of the triangle that is outside the circles, we need to first determine the radius of the circles and then calculate the area of the triangle and the circles. The circles are inscribed in the triangle, touching two sides and each other, forming a smaller equilateral triangle inside the original one.\n</think>\n<answer>\nLet's start by finding the radius of the circles. Since the circles are tangent to two sides of the triangle and each other, they form a smaller equilateral triangle inside the original one. The side length of this smaller triangle is equal to the distance between the points where the circles touch the sides of the original triangle, which is \\(a/2\\).\n\nThe radius \\(r\\) of the circles can be found using the relationship between the side length of the equilateral triangle and its radius. For an equilateral triangle with side length \\(a\\), the radius \\(r\\) of the inscribed circle is given by:\n\\[ r = \\frac{a \\sqrt{3}}{6} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the area of the triangle and the circles. The area of the original equilateral triangle is:\n\\[ \\text{Area of the triangle} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} a^2 \\]\n\nThe area of one circle is:\n\\[ \\text{Area of one circle} = \\pi r^2 = \\pi \\left( \\frac{a \\sqrt{3}}{6} \\right)^2 = \\frac{\\pi a^2}{12} \\]\n\nSince there are three circles, the total area of the circles is:\n\\[ \\text{Total area of the circles} = 3 \\times \\frac{\\pi a^2}{12} = \\frac{\\pi a^2}{4} \\]\n\nThe area of the part of the triangle that is outside the circles is the area of the triangle minus the total area of the circles:\n\\[ \\text{Area outside the circles} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} a^2 - \\frac{\\pi a^2}{4} = \\frac{a^2}{4} (\\sqrt{3} - \\pi) \\]\n\nSo, the area of the part of the triangle that is outside the circles is:\n\\[ \\frac{a^2}{4} (\\sqrt{3} - \\pi) \\]\n</answer>", "950_correct": false, "950_changed": false}

This means that after giving half of her mushrooms to Vitya, Anya will have \\( \\frac{A}{2} \\) mushrooms, and the total number of mushrooms will be \\( n \\times x \\). So, we can write:\n\\[ \\frac{A}{2} + x = n \\times x \\]\n\\[ \\frac{A}{2} = n \\times x - x \\]\n\\[ \\frac{A}{2} = (n-1) \\times x \\]\n\\[ A = 2 \\times (n-1) \\times x \\]\n\n2.

The parabola \\(C: y = \\frac{1}{2}x^2\\) and the circle \\(D: x^2 + \\left(y - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = r^2\\) have no common points, which means the circle is entirely outside the parabola.

The length of this chord can be calculated using the properties of the parabola and the circle.\n\nThe area of \\(\\Omega\\) is the area of the circle minus the area of the triangle formed by the line segment \\(EF\\) and the radii to the points of tangency.

Equality in the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality holds when \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) are proportional.

Let S be the set of 2 x 2 matrices over F with trace 1 and determinant 0. Find |S|. Solution\nassistant\n<think>\nTo find the number of 2x2 matrices over the field \\( F \\) with \\( p \\) elements that have a trace of 1 and determinant 0, we can use properties of determinants and traces in matrix algebra.\n</think>\n<answer>\nLet's denote the field \\( F \\) as \\( \\mathbb{F}_p \\), where \\( p \\) is a prime number. We are looking for 2x2 matrices \\( A = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\) over \\( \\mathbb{F}_p \\) such that the trace of \\( A \\) is 1 and the determinant of \\( A \\) is 0.\n\nThe trace of \\( A \\) is given by \\( a + d \\), and the determinant of \\( A \\) is given by \\( ad - bc \\). We need to find the number of such matrices.\n\nFirst, let's consider the condition for the determinant to be 0:\n\\[ ad - bc = 0 \\]\nThis implies that \\( bc = ad \\).\n\nNext, let's consider the condition for the trace to be 1:\n\\[ a + d = 1 \\]\nThis implies that \\( d = 1 - a \\).\n\nSubstituting \\( d = 1 - a \\) into the determinant condition, we get:\n\\[ bc = a(1 - a) \\]\n\\[ bc = a - a^2 \\]\n\nNow, we need to count the number of solutions to this equation in the field \\( \\mathbb{F}_p \\). For each \\( a \\in \\mathbb{F}_p \\), we need to count the number of pairs \\((b, c)\\) such that \\( bc = a - a^2 \\).\n\nFor each fixed \\( a \\), the equation \\( bc = a - a^2 \\) has exactly two solutions in \\( \\mathbb{F}_p \\) if \\( a - a^2 \\) is a non-zero element of \\( \\mathbb{F}_p \\). If \\( a - a^2 = 0 \\), then \\( a = 0 \\) or \\( a = 1 \\), and there is only one solution in each case (i.e., \\( b = 0 \\) and \\( c = 0 \\) or \\( b = 1 \\) and \\( c = 1 \\)).\n\nTherefore, for each \\( a \\in \\mathbb{F}_p \\), there are exactly 2 solutions for \\( (b, c) \\) in \\( \\mathbb{F}_p \\).\n\nSince there are \\( p \\) possible values for \\( a \\) and for", "950_correct": true, "950_changed": false}

On how many arrays is this possible?\nassistant\n<think>\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the operations Thaddeus can perform and how they affect the divisibility by 2013. The operations are:\n1. Subtract 1 from each entry in a row.\n2. Add 1 to each entry in a column.\n\nWe need to determine if it's possible to transform the initial array into an array where all entries are divisible by 2013 using these operations.\n\nFirst, let's consider the effect of the operations on the divisibility by 2013. If we subtract 1 from each entry in a row, the sum of the entries in that row modulo 2013 will decrease by 2013. Similarly, if we add 1 to each entry in a column, the sum of the entries in that column modulo 2013 will increase by 2013.\n\nTo achieve an array where all entries are divisible by 2013, we need to consider the initial sum of all entries modulo 2013. If the initial sum modulo 2013 is not divisible by 2013, it is impossible to make all entries divisible by 2013 using the given operations.\n\nNow, let's calculate the initial sum of all entries in the array. The array is a $2013 \\times 2013$ array of integers between 1 and 2013. The sum of all entries is:\n\\[ \\text{Sum} = 2013 \\times 2013 \\times \\frac{1 + 2013}{2} = 2013 \\times 2013 \\times 1007 \\]\n\nWe need to check if this sum is divisible by 2013. Since 2013 is a prime number, the sum is divisible by 2013 if and only if the sum of the entries is divisible by 2013. This is because 2013 is a prime number, and the sum of the entries is a multiple of 2013.\n\nTherefore, if the initial sum of all entries is divisible by 2013, it is possible to transform the array into an array where all entries are divisible by 2013 using the given operations.

The key points are the areas of triangles \\(AOB\\) and \\(COD\\) and the length of \\(BC\\).\n</think>\n<answer>\nGiven that \\(S_{AOB} = S_{COD} = \\frac{3}{2}\\), we can use the fact that the diagonals of a quadrilateral divide it into four triangles, and the areas of these triangles are proportional to the segments they cut on the diagonals. Let's denote the areas of triangles \\(AOB\\), \\(BOC\\), \\(COD\\), and \\(DOA\\) as \\(S_{AOB} = S_{COD} = \\frac{3}{2}\\) and \\(S_{BOC} = S_{DOA} = x\\).\n\nSince the diagonals intersect at point \\(O\\), the areas of triangles \\(AOB\\) and \\(COD\\) are equal, and the areas of triangles \\(BOC\\) and \\(DOA\\) are equal. Therefore, we have:\n\\[ S_{AOB} = S_{COD} = \\frac{3}{2} \\]\n\\[ S_{BOC} = S_{DOA} = \\frac{3}{2} \\]\n\nThe total area of quadrilateral \\(ABCD\\) is the sum of the areas of these four triangles:\n\\[ S_{ABCD} = S_{AOB} + S_{BOC} + S_{COD} + S_{DOA} = \\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{3}{2} = 6 \\]\n\nHowever, we need to check if this is the smallest possible area. To do this, we need to consider the constraints given by the length of \\(BC\\) and the cosine of \\(\\angle ADC\\).\n\nThe length of \\(BC\\) is given as \\(3\\sqrt{2}\\). The cosine of \\(\\angle ADC\\) is \\(\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{10}}\\), which is a fixed value. This means that the shape of the quadrilateral is constrained by these geometric properties.\n\nGiven the symmetry and the fixed cosine value, the smallest possible area is indeed the sum of the areas of the four triangles, which is 6. This is because any deviation from this configuration would either increase the area or violate the given conditions.\n\nTherefore, the smallest area that such a quadrilateral can have is:\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]\n</answer>", "950_correct": true, "950_changed": false}

The sequence of positive integers is $1, 2, 3, \\cdots$, and we remove all perfect squares from it. The perfect squares in this sequence are $1, 4, 9, 16, \\cdots$. So, the sequence of positive integers without perfect squares is $2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, \\cdots$.\n\nWe need to find the 2003rd term of this sequence. To do this, we need to count how many perfect squares are there up to a certain point. The number of perfect squares up to $n$ is $\\lfloor \\sqrt{n} \\rfloor$. So, we need to find the largest $n$ such that $\\lfloor \\sqrt{n} \\rfloor \\leq 2003$.\n\nLet's calculate this step by step:\n- For $n = 2003$, $\\lfloor \\sqrt{2003} \\rfloor = 44$ (since $44^2 = 1936$ and $45^2 = 2025$).\n- For $n = 2004$, $\\lfloor \\sqrt{2004} \\rfloor = 44$ (since $44^2 = 1936$ and $45^2 = 2025$).\n- For $n = 2005$, $\\lfloor \\sqrt{2005} \\rfloor = 44$ (since $44^2 = 1936$ and $45^2 = 2025$).\n\nSo, the 2003rd term of the sequence is the 2003rd term of the sequence of positive integers minus the 44th perfect square (since the perfect squares up to 2003 are counted 44 times).\n\nThe 2003rd term of the sequence of positive integers is $2003 + 44 = 2047$.\n\nTherefore, the 2003rd term of the sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ is 2047.\n</think>\n<answer>\n(B) 2047\n</answer>", "950_correct": false, "950_changed": false}

The first condition is straightforward: $a_1 = 2021^{2021}$. The second condition states that for any $k \\ge 2$, $0 \\le a_k < k$. The third condition is a bit more complex: the sum $a_1 - a_2 + a_3 - a_4 + \\cdots + (-1)^{k+1}a_k$ is a multiple of $k$ for all positive integers $k$.\n\nLet's analyze the third condition. If we consider the sum $S_k = a_1 - a_2 + a_3 - a_4 + \\cdots + (-1)^{k+1}a_k$, we can see that it alternates between positive and negative terms. The key insight here is that $S_k$ is always a multiple of $k$. This means that the sum of the first $k$ terms of the sequence is always a multiple of $k$.\n\nNow, let's consider the sequence modulo $k$. Since $S_k$ is a multiple of $k$, we have $S_k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{k}$. This implies that the sum of the first $k$ terms of the sequence is divisible by $k$. \n\nTo find the $2021^{2022}$th term, we need to consider the pattern of the sequence. The sequence alternates between positive and negative terms, and the sum of the first $k$ terms is always a multiple of $k$. This suggests that the sequence might have a periodic pattern modulo $k$.\n\nGiven the complexity of the problem, we can infer that the sequence might be periodic with a period that is a divisor of $2021^{2022}$. The exact period is not immediately clear, but we can use the given conditions to deduce that the sequence must be periodic with a period that is a divisor of $2021^{2022}$.\n\nSince the sequence is defined by the conditions given, we can conclude that the $2021^{2022}$th term of the sequence is the same as the $2021^{2022}$th term of the sequence modulo $2021^{2022}$. Given the periodicity and the alternating pattern, we can deduce that the $2021^{2022}$th term is $0$.\n\nTherefore, the $2021^{2022}$th term of the sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ is $0$.\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe $2021^{2022}$th term of the sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ is $0$.\n</answer>", "950_correct": true, "950_changed": false}

The key insight is that Vera can use a strategy to ensure that Marco cannot make a move that leaves him in a position where he can choose a black cell with more than two white neighbors.\n\nTo achieve this, Vera can use a strategy that involves swapping the colors of neighboring cells in a way that disrupts Marco's ability to make such a move. Specifically, Vera can use a \"swapping\" strategy where she swaps the colors of neighboring cells in such a way that Marco's moves become less effective.\n\nThe minimal \\( k \\) value such that Vera can guarantee a win is \\( k = 3 \\).

We can try to factorize the right-hand side and see if we can find any patterns or constraints on the primes $p$, $q$, and $r$.\n\nFirst, let's consider the case where $p = q = r$. If $p = q = r$, then the equation becomes $(p+1)^3 = 4p^3$. This simplifies to $p^3 + 3p^2 + 3p + 1 = 4p^3$, which further simplifies to $3p^3 - 3p^2 - 3p - 1 = 0$. This is a cubic equation in $p$, and we can try to find integer solutions for $p$.\n\nBy inspection, we can see that $p = 1$ is a solution, but it does not satisfy the original equation since $1+1 = 2$ and $4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = 4$, and $2 \\neq 4$. Therefore, $p = q = r$ is not a solution.\n\nNext, let's consider the case where $p = q$ and $r \\neq p$. We can substitute $q = p$ into the equation, which gives us $(p+1)(2p+2)(r+3) = 4p^2r$. Simplifying, we get $(p+1)(p+1)(r+3) = 4p^2r$, or $(p+1)^2(r+3) = 4p^2r$.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where $r = p$. We can substitute $r = p$ into the equation, which gives us $(p+1)(q+2)(p+3) = 4pq^2$. Simplifying, we get $(p+1)(q+2)(p+3) = 4pq^2$.\n\nFinally, let's consider the case where $p \\neq q$ and $q \\neq r$. We can substitute $q = r$ into the equation, which gives us $(p+1)(q+2)(q+3) = 4pq^2$. Simplifying, we get $(p+1)(q+2)(q+3) = 4pq^2$.\n\nAfter considering these cases, we can see that the only solution is when $p = q = r = 2$. Let's verify this solution:\n$(2+1)(2+2)(2+3) = 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 32$.\n$(2+1)(2+2)(2+3) = 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5 = 60$.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is $(p, q, r) = (2, 2, 2)$.\n</answer>", "950_correct": false, "950_changed": false}

Find all possible values for angle BCQ such that RST is equilateral.\nassistant\n<think>\nTo solve this problem, we need to analyze the geometric configuration and use properties of equilateral triangles, midpoints, and orthocenters. We are given that \\(ABC\\) is an equilateral triangle, and we need to find the possible values of \\(\\angle BCQ\\) such that \\(RST\\) is an equilateral triangle, where \\(R\\) and \\(S\\) are the orthocenters of \\(\\triangle ABP\\) and \\(\\triangle ACQ\\) respectively, and \\(T\\) is the intersection of \\(BP\\) and \\(CQ\\).\n</think>\n<answer>\nLet's start by considering the properties of the equilateral triangle \\(ABC\\). Since \\(ABC\\) is equilateral, all its angles are \\(60^\\circ\\) and all its sides are equal. The midpoints \\(M\\) and \\(N\\) of \\(AC\\) and \\(AB\\) respectively, form a smaller equilateral triangle \\(AMN\\) inside \\(ABC\\).\n\nThe orthocenter \\(R\\) of \\(\\triangle ABP\\) is the point where the altitudes of \\(\\triangle ABP\\) intersect. Similarly, the orthocenter \\(S\\) of \\(\\triangle ACQ\\) is the point where the altitudes of \\(\\triangle ACQ\\) intersect. The lines \\(BP\\) and \\(CQ\\) intersect at point \\(T\\).\n\nFor \\(RST\\) to be an equilateral triangle, the angles \\(\\angle RST\\), \\(\\angle STR\\), and \\(\\angle RTS\\) must all be \\(60^\\circ\\). This implies that the configuration of the points and lines must be symmetric and specific.\n\nGiven the symmetry and the properties of the equilateral triangle, we can deduce that \\(\\angle BCQ = 60^\\circ\\) is a key angle. This is because if \\(\\angle BCQ = 60^\\circ\\), then the configuration of the points and lines will naturally form an equilateral triangle \\(RST\\).\n\nTo verify, consider the following:\n1. Since \\(ABC\\) is equilateral, \\(\\angle BAC = 60^\\circ\\).\n2. If \\(\\angle BCQ = 60^\\circ\\), then \\(\\angle BQC = 120^\\circ\\) because \\(\\angle BQC = 180^\\circ - \\angle BCQ = 180^\\circ - 60^\\circ = 120^\\circ\\).\n3. The orthocenter \\(S\\) of \\(\\triangle ACQ\\) will be such that \\(\\angle ACS = 60^\\circ\\) because \\(ACQ\\) is also an equilateral triangle.\n4. The intersection \\(T\\) of \\(BP\\) and \\(CQ\\) will form an equilateral triangle \\(RST\\) because the angles and symmetry are preserved.\n\nTherefore, the only possible value for \\(\\angle BCQ\\) that satisfies the condition that \\(RST\\) is an equilateral triangle is \\(\\boxed{60^\\circ}\\).\n</answer>", "950_correct": false, "950_changed": false}

The possible pairs $(U, T)$ that satisfy this condition are $(1, 15)$, $(3, 5)$, $(5, 3)$, and $(15, 1)$.

The possible pairs $(S, L)$ that satisfy this condition are $(1, 8)$, $(2, 4)$, $(4, 2)$, and $(8, 1)$.

Since $U$ and $T$ are different from $E$, $U$, and $L$, and $U$ and $T$ are also different from each other, we can deduce that $E$ must be 1, because if $E$ were 2 or more, the sum of $E$, $U$, and $L$ would be greater than 6. Therefore, $E=1$.\n\nNow we have $E=1$, $U=3$, and $T=5$. This means $U \\times T=15$ is satisfied. Next, we need to find $S$ and $L$ that satisfy $S \\times L=8$ and $S+R+U+T=18$.

A tetrahedron has 12 rotational symmetries, which means it can be rotated in 12 different ways that look the same.\n\nEach of these symmetries corresponds to a plane of symmetry.
