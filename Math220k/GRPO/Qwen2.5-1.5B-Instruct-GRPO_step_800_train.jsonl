Find the angles of the triangle.\nassistant\n<think>\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the altitudes and the sides of a triangle. The key insight is that if two altitudes are not smaller than the sides on which they are dropped, it implies that the triangle is isosceles. This is because in an isosceles triangle, the altitude from the vertex angle to the base is equal to the length of the base, and the altitude from the base angles to the opposite sides are equal to the lengths of the legs of the triangle.\n\nGiven that two altitudes are not smaller than the sides on which they are dropped, we can deduce that the triangle must be isosceles. Let's denote the angles of the triangle as \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\), where \\(A\\) is the vertex angle and \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) are the base angles.\n\nSince the triangle is isosceles, we have two possible cases:\n1. \\(A = B\\)\n2. \\(A = C\\)\n\nLet's consider the first case where \\(A = B\\).

Suppose that the point starts at the origin and begins motion in the direction of $(1,1)$. After the ball has traveled a cumulative distance of $30\\sqrt{2}$, compute its distance from the origin.\nassistant\n<think>\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand the path of the point as it bounces inside the equilateral triangle. The key is to recognize that the point's path can be broken down into a series of straight-line segments, each of which is a reflection of the original path across an edge of the triangle.\n\nGiven that the point starts at the origin and moves in the direction of $(1,1)$, we can represent this direction vector as $(1,1)$. The cumulative distance traveled is $30\\sqrt{2}$, which is the length of the vector $(1,1)$ scaled by some factor. This factor is the number of times the point has traveled the length of $(1,1)$.\n\nThe length of the vector $(1,1)$ is $\\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, the point has traveled $\\frac{30\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}} = 30$ times the length of $(1,1)$.\n\nSince the point bounces elastically off the edges of the triangle, each bounce changes the direction of the vector by $90^\\circ$. This means that after each bounce, the point's path can be represented as a series of vectors that are reflections of the original direction vector across the edges of the triangle.\n\nTo find the distance from the origin after 30 bounces, we need to consider the effect of these reflections. Each bounce changes the direction of the vector by $90^\\circ$, and after an even number of bounces, the vector will be in the same direction as the original direction vector. After an odd number of bounces, the vector will be in the opposite direction.\n\nSince 30 is an even number, the point's path after 30 bounces will be in the same direction as the original direction vector. Therefore, the distance from the origin after 30 bounces is the same as the distance from the origin after 30 times the length of $(1,1)$.\n\nThe distance from the origin after 30 times the length of $(1,1)$ is $30 \\times \\sqrt{2} = 30\\sqrt{2}$.\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe distance from the origin after 30 bounces is $30\\sqrt{2}$.\n</answer>", "800_correct": false, "800_changed": false}

Inside an equilateral triangle with side $a$, there are three equal circles, each of which touches two sides of the triangle and two other circles.

Since the circles touch two sides of the triangle and two other circles, we can see that the radius of each circle is equal to the distance from the center of the circle to the side of the triangle. This distance is also equal to the height of the equilateral triangle minus the radius of the circle.\nThe height of an equilateral triangle with side length $a$ is given by $h = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}a$. Therefore, the radius of each circle is $r = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{6}a$.\nNow, let's calculate the area of the triangle and the circles. The area of the triangle is given by $A_{\\triangle} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}a^2$.\nThe area of one circle is given by $A_{circle} = \\pi r^2 = \\pi \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{6}a\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\pi}{12}a^2$.\nSince there are three circles, the total area of the circles is $A_{circles} = 3 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{12}a^2 = \\frac{\\pi}{4}a^2$.\nFinally, the area of the part of the triangle that is outside the circles is given by $A_{outside} = A_{\\triangle} - A_{circles} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}a^2 - \\frac{\\pi}{4}a^2 = \\frac{(\\sqrt{3} - \\pi)}{4}a^2$.\n</answer>", "800_correct": false, "800_changed": false}

How many children went to pick mushrooms\nassistant\n<think>\nLet's denote the number of children as \\( n \\) and the number of mushrooms Anya has as \\( A \\). Let's also denote the number of mushrooms each child has as \\( m \\).\n\nFrom the problem, we know that if Anya gives half of her mushrooms to Vitya, all the children will have the same number of mushrooms. This means that after giving half of her mushrooms to Vitya, Anya will have \\( \\frac{A}{2} \\) mushrooms left, and each child will have \\( m + \\frac{A}{2n} \\) mushrooms. Since this is the same for all children, we can write:\n\\[ m + \\frac{A}{2n} = m \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ \\frac{A}{2n} = 0 \\]\nThis implies that \\( A = 0 \\), which is not possible since Anya has mushrooms. Instead, we need to consider the second condition, where Anya gives all her mushrooms to Sasha, and Sasha will have as many mushrooms as all the others combined. This means that after giving all her mushrooms to Sasha, Anya will have \\( A - m \\) mushrooms left, and Sasha will have \\( A \\) mushrooms. The remaining \\( n-1 \\) children will have \\( m \\) mushrooms each. So, we can write:\n\\[ A - m = (n-1)m \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ A = (n-1)m + m = nm \\]\nNow, we need to find a value of \\( n \\) that satisfies both conditions. Let's try \\( n = 3 \\):\nIf \\( n = 3 \\), then Anya has \\( A = 3m \\). After giving half of her mushrooms to Vitya, Anya will have \\( \\frac{3m}{2} \\) mushrooms left, and each child will have \\( m + \\frac{3m}{6} = m + \\frac{m}{2} = \\frac{3m}{2} \\) mushrooms. This is the same for all children, so the first condition is satisfied. Now, if Anya gives all her mushrooms to Sasha, Sasha will have \\( 3m \\) mushrooms, and the remaining 2 children will have \\( m \\) mushrooms each. So, the second condition is also satisfied.\nTherefore, the number of children is \\( n = 3 \\).\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe number of children who went to pick mushrooms is \\( \\boxed{3} \\).\n</answer>", "800_correct": false, "800_changed": false}

We can do this by calculating the sum of the floor functions:\n\\[\\left[\\frac{3638801}{1!}\\right] + \\left[\\frac{3638801}{2!}\\right] + \\cdots + \\left[\\frac{3638801}{10!}\\right]\\]\n\nSince $3638801$ is just above $10!$, all terms $\\left[\\frac{3638801}{n!}\\right]$ will be equal to $3638801$ for $n = 1, 2, \\ldots, 10$. Therefore, the sum is:\n\\[3638801 + 3638801 + \\cdots + 3638801 = 10 \\times 3638801 = 36388010\\]\n\nThis is not equal to 1001, so $x = 3638801$ is not the solution. We need to find the next integer, which is $x = 3638802$.\n\nLet's check $x = 3638802$:", "800_correct": false, "800_changed": false}

A cube is inscribed in a regular quadrilateral pyramid; the vertices of its upper base lie on the lateral edges, and the vertices of its lower base are in the plane of the pyramid's base. Find the ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the pyramid, if the lateral edge of the pyramid makes an angle $\\alpha$ with the base plane.\nassistant\n<think>\nTo find the ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the pyramid, we need to consider the geometric properties of the pyramid and the cube. Let's start by understanding the relationship between the cube and the pyramid.\n\nGiven that the cube is inscribed in the pyramid, the vertices of the cube's upper base lie on the lateral edges of the pyramid, and the vertices of the cube's lower base are in the plane of the pyramid's base. This configuration implies that the cube is oriented such that its edges are parallel to the edges of the pyramid.\n\nThe key to solving this problem is to determine the relationship between the side length of the cube and the dimensions of the pyramid. Let's denote the side length of the cube as \\(a\\). The height of the pyramid can be denoted as \\(h\\), and the lateral edge of the pyramid as \\(l\\).\n\nSince the cube is inscribed in the pyramid, the height of the pyramid can be expressed in terms of the side length of the cube and the angle \\(\\alpha\\) that the lateral edge makes with the base plane. The height of the pyramid can be written as:\n\\[ h = a \\cot \\alpha \\]\n\nThe volume of the pyramid is given by:\n\\[ V_{\\text{pyramid}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{Base Area} \\times \\text{Height} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times a^2 \\times a \\cot \\alpha = \\frac{1}{3} a^3 \\cot \\alpha \\]\n\nThe volume of the cube is:\n\\[ V_{\\text{cube}} = a^3 \\]\n\nThe ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the pyramid is:\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{V_{\\text{cube}}}{V_{\\text{pyramid}}} = \\frac{a^3}{\\frac{1}{3} a^3 \\cot \\alpha} = \\frac{3}{\\cot \\alpha} = 3 \\tan \\alpha \\]\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the pyramid is:\n\\[ \\boxed{3 \\tan \\alpha} \\]\n</think>\n<answer>\n\\[ \\boxed{3 \\tan \\alpha} \\]\n</answer>", "800_correct": false, "800_changed": false}

Let the speed of the pedestrian be $v_p$ and the speed of the cyclist be $v_c$. After one hour, the pedestrian is three times farther from the cyclist than from point $A$. This means that the pedestrian is $d/3$ away from the cyclist and $d/3$ away from point $A$. The cyclist is $d/3$ away from the pedestrian and $d/3$ away from point $A$.

At this point, the pedestrian has traveled half the distance $d$ and the cyclist has traveled half the distance $d$.

So, the sequence of positive integers without perfect squares is $2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, \\cdots$.\n\nWe need to find the 2003rd term of this sequence.

Let's consider the sum up to $k$ terms:\n\\[ S_k = a_1 - a_2 + a_3 - a_4 + \\cdots + (-1)^{k+1}a_k. \\]\nWe need to find $S_{2021^{2022}}$.\n\nGiven the conditions, we can infer that the sequence might be constructed in a way that the sum of every two consecutive terms is a multiple of their index.

The mean is the sum of all weights divided by the number of children. The weights are 106 pounds, 5 pounds, 5 pounds, 6 pounds, and 8 pounds. The sum of these weights is 106 + 5 + 5 + 6 + 8 = 130 pounds. Since there are 5 children, the mean weight is 130 / 5 = 26 pounds.\n\nNext, let's calculate the median. The median is the middle value when the weights are arranged in ascending order. Arranging the weights in ascending order, we get 5, 5, 6, 8, 106. The middle value is 6 pounds. Therefore, the median weight is 6 pounds.\n\nNow, we compare the mean and the median. The mean is 26 pounds, and the median is 6 pounds.

At the beginning, only one cell is black and the rest are white. \n\tA turn in this game consists of the following.

Compute $100m + t$.\n\n[i]Proposed by Ashwin Sah[/i]\nassistant\n<think>\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand the game dynamics and the conditions under which Vera can guarantee a win. Let's break it down step by step.\n</think>\n<answer>\nLet's start by analyzing the game. Marco's goal is to make a cell black that has more than two white neighbors. Vera's goal is to prevent Marco from doing this by swapping the colors of two neighboring cells.\n\nFirst, let's consider the initial state of the grid. There is one black cell and the rest are white. Marco's move will turn this black cell white and all its neighbors black. Vera's move will swap the colors of two neighboring cells.\n\nTo guarantee a win, Vera needs to ensure that Marco cannot make a cell black with more than two white neighbors. This means that Vera needs to prevent Marco from making any cell black with more than two white neighbors.\n\nNow, let's think about the minimal value of $k$ such that Vera can guarantee a win. If $k=1$, Vera can only swap the colors of two neighboring cells, which is not enough to prevent Marco from making a cell black with more than two white neighbors. However, if $k=2$, Vera can swap the colors of two neighboring cells, which is enough to prevent Marco from making a cell black with more than two white neighbors.\n\nTherefore, the minimal value of $k$ such that Vera can guarantee a win is $k=2$.\n\nNow, let's consider the smallest positive integer $t$ such that Vera can guarantee a win after at most $t$ turns. Since $k=2$, Vera can guarantee a win after at most $2$ turns. Therefore, $t=2$.\n\nFinally, we need to compute $100m + t$. Since $m=2$ and $t=2$, we have $100m + t = 100(2) + 2 = 202$.\n</answer>", "800_correct": false, "800_changed": false}

When a point is symmetric to another point with respect to the \\(x\\)-axis, their \\(x\\)-coordinates remain the same, and their \\(y\\)-coordinates are negatives of each other. Similarly, when a point is symmetric to another point with respect to the origin, both the \\(x\\)-coordinate and the \\(y\\)-coordinate are negated.\n\nGiven point \\(P_1(3, a)\\) is symmetric to point \\(P_2(b, -2)\\) with respect to the \\(x\\)-axis, we can set up the following equations:\n1. The \\(x\\)-coordinates must be equal: \\(3 = b\\).\n2. The \\(y\\)-coordinates must be negatives of each other: \\(a = -(-2) = 2\\).\n\nSo, we have \\(a = 2\\) and \\(b = 3\\).\n\nNext, we need to find the coordinates of the point \\(P_1\\) symmetric to the \\(y\\)-axis and the origin. The point symmetric to \\(P_1(3, 2)\\) with respect to the \\(y\\)-axis will have the same \\(y\\)-coordinate but the opposite \\(x\\)-coordinate. Therefore, the coordinates are \\((-3, 2)\\).\n\nThe point symmetric to \\(P_1(3, 2)\\) with respect to the origin will have both the \\(x\\)-coordinate and the \\(y\\)-coordinate negated. Therefore, the coordinates are \\((-3, -2)\\).\n\nSo, the values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are \\(2\\) and \\(3\\) respectively, and the coordinates of the point \\(P_1\\) symmetric to the \\(y\\)-axis and the origin are \\((-3, 2)\\) and \\((-3, -2)\\) respectively.\n</think>\n<answer>\n\\(a = 2\\), \\(b = 3\\), the coordinates of the point \\(P_1\\) symmetric to the \\(y\\)-axis are \\((-3, 2)\\), and the coordinates of the point \\(P_1\\) symmetric to the origin are \\((-3, -2)\\).\n</answer>", "800_correct": true, "800_changed": false}

Let's denote the length of the segment \\(O_1O_2\\) as \\(d\\). The circles with centers \\(O_1\\) and \\(O_2\\) have radii 4 cm and 6 cm, respectively. The secant passing through the intersection points of these circles intersects the segment \\(O_1O_2\\) at point \\(T\\), and the ratio \\(AT:BT = 1:2\\).\n\nFirst, we need to understand that the power of a point theorem can be applied here. The power of point \\(T\\) with respect to both circles is the same because \\(T\\) lies on the secant line. The power of point \\(T\\) with respect to the larger circle is \\(TA \\cdot TB = 4^2 = 16\\), and the power of point \\(T\\) with respect to the smaller circle is \\(TA \\cdot TB = 6^2 = 36\\).

Since \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are points of intersection of the smaller and larger circles with \\(T\\) on the secant, we can use the fact that the ratio \\(AT:BT = 1:2\\) to find the length of \\(O_1O_2\\).\n\nLet's denote the length of \\(O_1O_2\\) as \\(d\\).

Let's start by identifying the angles around the point where the three line segments intersect.\n\n1. The angles around the point sum up to 360 degrees.\n2. We can see that one of the angles is 120 degrees, and another is 100 degrees.\n3. The remaining angle, which is $x$, can be found by subtracting the sum of the other two angles from 360 degrees.\n\nSo, $x = 360 - 120 - 100 = 140$ degrees.\n\nHowever, this doesn't match any of the given options. Let's re-evaluate the problem.\n\nUpon closer inspection, we notice that the angles around the point are not directly given, but we can use the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.\n\nLet's assume the angles around the point are $x$, $120$ degrees, and $100$ degrees. The third angle in the triangle formed by the intersection of the lines is $x$.\n\nSo, $x + 120 + 100 = 180$.\n\nSolving for $x$, we get $x = 180 - 120 - 100 = 60$ degrees.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) 60.\n</answer>", "800_correct": false, "800_changed": false}

Since \\( n \\equiv 7 \\pmod{9} \\), we have:\n\\[ 3n \\equiv 3 \\cdot 7 \\equiv 21 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{9} \\]\n\nTherefore, the sum of the digits of \\( 3n \\) is congruent to 3 modulo 9. Given that the sum of the digits of \\( 3n \\) is a single digit number, it must be 3.\n\nThus, the sum of the digits of \\( 3n \\) is \\( 3 \\).\n</think>\n<answer>\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]\n</answer>", "800_correct": false, "800_changed": false}
