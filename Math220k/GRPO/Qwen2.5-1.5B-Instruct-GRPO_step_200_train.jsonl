The key is to calculate the probability of drawing all 3 red chips before drawing both green chips. We can break this down into two main cases: drawing all 3 red chips before drawing both green chips, and drawing both green chips before drawing all 3 red chips.\n\n1. **Drawing all 3 red chips before drawing both green chips:**\n   - The probability of drawing a red chip on the first draw is $\\frac{3}{5}$.\n   - After drawing a red chip, there are 2 red chips left and 4 chips in total, so the probability of drawing another red chip is $\\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n   - After drawing two red chips, there is 1 red chip left and 3 chips in total, so the probability of drawing the last red chip is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n   - The combined probability for this case is $\\frac{3}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{10}$.\n\n2. **Drawing both green chips before drawing all 3 red chips:**\n   - The probability of drawing a green chip on the first draw is $\\frac{2}{5}$.\n   - After drawing a green chip, there are 1 green chip left and 4 chips in total, so the probability of drawing another green chip is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n   - After drawing two green chips, there are 3 chips left, and the probability of drawing a red chip is $\\frac{3}{3} = 1$.\n   - The combined probability for this case is $\\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{4} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{10}$.\n\nThe total probability of drawing all 3 red chips before drawing both green chips is the sum of the probabilities of these two cases:\n$$\\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{2}{10} = \\frac{1}{5}$$\n\nHowever, this is not the correct approach. The correct approach involves considering the total number of ways to draw the chips and the favorable outcomes.

A cube is inscribed in a regular quadrilateral pyramid; the vertices of its upper base lie on the lateral edges, and the vertices of its lower base are in the plane of the pyramid's base. Find the ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the pyramid, if the lateral edge of the pyramid makes an angle $\\alpha$ with the base plane.\nassistant\n<think>\nTo find the ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the pyramid, we need to consider the geometric properties of the pyramid and the cube. Let's start by understanding the relationship between the cube and the pyramid.\n\nGiven that the cube is inscribed in the pyramid, the vertices of the cube's upper base lie on the lateral edges of the pyramid, and the vertices of the cube's lower base are in the plane of the pyramid's base. This configuration implies that the cube is oriented such that its edges are parallel to the edges of the pyramid.\n\nThe lateral edge of the pyramid makes an angle $\\alpha$ with the base plane. This angle helps us determine the height of the pyramid and the side length of the cube.\n\nLet's denote the side length of the cube as $s$. The height of the pyramid can be expressed in terms of $s$ and $\\alpha$. The height of the pyramid can be found using trigonometry, considering the right triangle formed by the height of the pyramid, the lateral edge, and the projection of the lateral edge onto the base plane.\n\nThe volume of the cube is $V_{\\text{cube}} = s^3$.\n\nThe volume of the pyramid is $V_{\\text{pyramid}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{Base Area} \\times \\text{Height}$.\n\nSince the cube is inscribed in the pyramid, the base area of the pyramid is the same as the area of the cube's lower base. The height of the pyramid can be expressed as $h = s \\tan(\\alpha)$.\n\nThe volume of the pyramid is then $V_{\\text{pyramid}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times s^2 \\times s \\tan(\\alpha) = \\frac{1}{3} s^3 \\tan(\\alpha)$.\n\nThe ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the pyramid is:\n\\[\n\\frac{V_{\\text{cube}}}{V_{\\text{pyramid}}} = \\frac{s^3}{\\frac{1}{3} s^3 \\tan(\\alpha)} = \\frac{3}{\\tan(\\alpha)}\n\\]\n\nThus, the ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the pyramid is $\\frac{3}{\\tan(\\alpha)}$.\n</think>\n<answer>\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{\\tan(\\alpha)}\n\\]\n</answer>", "200_correct": false, "200_changed": false}

The key insight is that the derivative of a polynomial can have at most as many roots as the polynomial itself, but it can have fewer roots if the polynomial has repeated roots.\n\nGiven that $P(x^2)$ has $2n+1$ roots, we need to determine the smallest number of roots that $P(x)$ can have. The polynomial $P(x^2)$ is a transformation of $P(x)$, and the roots of $P(x^2)$ are the values of $x$ for which $P(x^2) = 0$. If $P(x^2)$ has $2n+1$ roots, then $P(x)$ must have $2n+1$ values of $x$ such that $P(x) = 0$ when squared. This means that $P(x)$ must have at least $2n+1$ roots, because each root of $P(x^2)$ corresponds to two roots of $P(x)$ (one for each square root of the root).\n\nThe derivative of a polynomial can have at most as many roots as the polynomial itself, but it can have fewer roots if the polynomial has repeated roots. Since $P(x)$ has at least $2n+1$ roots, the derivative of $P(x)$ can have at most $2n+1$ roots, but it can have fewer roots if $P(x)$ has repeated roots.

However, 4 is not in the set, so there is no permutation \\(\\sigma\\) that satisfies this condition.\n\nFor \\( n \\geq 4 \\), the same argument applies. The only perfect squares in the set \\(\\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}\\) are 1 and 4, but 4 is not in the set for \\( n \\geq 4 \\).

This cell and its neighbors become white. Vera then swaps the colors of two neighboring cells.\n\n2. **Vera's Strategy**: Vera's goal is to ensure that Marco cannot choose a black cell with more than two white neighbors. To do this, Vera needs to ensure that the board is in a state where no such cell exists.\n\n3. **State Transition Analysis**: Each turn, Vera can swap the colors of two neighboring cells.

This is because after three turns, Vera can ensure that the board is in a state where no black cell has more than two white neighbors.

Since \\(p, q, r\\) are primes, they can be either 3 or 1 modulo 3. However, if any of \\(p, q, r\\) were 3, then \\(p+1, q+2, r+3\\) would be 4, 5, or 6, which are not all divisible by 3.

Find all possible values for angle BCQ such that RST is equilateral.\nassistant\n<think>\nTo solve this problem, we need to analyze the geometric properties of the equilateral triangle and the orthocenters. Let's start by understanding the configuration and the properties of the orthocenters R and S.\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe problem involves finding the angle BCQ such that the triangle RST is equilateral. Given that ABC is an equilateral triangle, we know that all its angles are 60 degrees. The orthocenter of a triangle is the point where the altitudes intersect. For an equilateral triangle, the orthocenter, circumcenter, and centroid coincide at the same point, which is the center of the triangle.\n\nSince R and S are the orthocenters of triangles ABP and ACQ respectively, and RST is equilateral, we need to consider the geometric properties of the equilateral triangle and the orthocenters. The key insight here is that the orthocenters of the triangles formed by the altitudes of the equilateral triangle will form an equilateral triangle if the angles at B and C are such that the orthocenters R and S are symmetrically placed with respect to the line BC.\n\nGiven that ABC is equilateral, the angle BCQ must be such that the configuration of the orthocenters R and S, and the line T, results in an equilateral triangle RST. This implies that the angle BCQ must be 60 degrees, as this is the only angle that allows the orthocenters to form an equilateral triangle when the triangle is equilateral.\n\nTherefore, the only possible value for angle BCQ such that RST is equilateral is 60 degrees.\n</answer>", "200_correct": false, "200_changed": false}

When a point is symmetric to another point with respect to the x-axis, their x-coordinates remain the same, and their y-coordinates are negatives of each other. Similarly, when a point is symmetric to another point with respect to the y-axis, their y-coordinates remain the same, and their x-coordinates are negatives of each other.\n\nGiven point $P_{1}(3, a)$ is symmetric to point $P_{2}(b, -2)$ with respect to the x-axis, we can deduce that:\n- The x-coordinate of $P_{1}$ is the same as the x-coordinate of $P_{2}$, so $3 = b$.\n- The y-coordinate of $P_{1}$ is the negative of the y-coordinate of $P_{2}$, so $a = -(-2) = 2$.\n\nNow, to find the coordinates of the point $P_{1}$ symmetric to the y-axis, we change the sign of the x-coordinate while keeping the y-coordinate the same. So, the symmetric point to $P_{1}(3, 2)$ with respect to the y-axis is $P_{3}( -3, 2)$.\n\nTo find the coordinates of the point $P_{1}$ symmetric to the origin, we change the signs of both the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate.

Notice that:\n\\[\n\\frac{a(b^2 + 1)}{a + b} = \\frac{a b^2 + a}{a + b} = \\frac{a b^2 + a}{a + b} = \\frac{a b^2 + a}{a + b}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, we can simplify the other terms:\n\\[\n\\frac{b(c^2 + 1)}{b + c} = \\frac{b c^2 + b}{b + c} = \\frac{b c^2 + b}{b + c}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{c(a^2 + 1)}{c + a} = \\frac{c a^2 + c}{c + a} = \\frac{c a^2 + c}{c + a}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's consider the sum of these terms:\n\\[\n\\frac{a b^2 + a}{a + b} + \\frac{b c^2 + b}{b + c} + \\frac{c a^2 + c}{c + a}\n\\]\n\nWe can rewrite each term as:\n\\[\n\\frac{a b^2 + a}{a + b} = \\frac{a (b^2 + 1)}{a + b}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{b c^2 + b}{b + c} = \\frac{b (c^2 + 1)}{b + c}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{c a^2 + c}{c + a} = \\frac{c (a^2 + 1)}{c + a}\n\\]\n\nThus, the expression becomes:\n\\[\n\\frac{a (b^2 + 1)}{a + b} + \\frac{b (c^2 + 1)}{b + c} + \\frac{c (a^2 + 1)}{c + a}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find a way to simplify this expression further. We can use the constraint \\(ab + bc + ca = 1\\) to find a relationship between \\(a, b, c\\). However, this approach might be complex, so let's consider a simpler approach by testing specific values for \\(a, b, c\\).\n\nLet's test the case where \\(a = b = c\\). Then:\n\\[\nab + bc + ca = a^2 + a^2 + a^2 = 3a^2 = 1 \\implies a^2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\implies a = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(a = b = c = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\) into the expression, we get:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)\\left(\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^2 + 1\\right)}{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}} + \\frac{\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)\\left(\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^2 + 1\\right)}{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}} + \\frac{\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)\\", "200_correct": false, "200_changed": false}

To determine the maximum number of planes of symmetry a tetrahedron can have, we need to consider the symmetries of the tetrahedron.\n\nA tetrahedron has 4 vertices, 6 edges, and 4 triangular faces. The symmetries of a tetrahedron include rotations and reflections that map the tetrahedron onto itself. The maximum number of planes of symmetry is achieved when the tetrahedron is symmetric in a way that allows for the maximum number of planes of symmetry.\n\nA tetrahedron has 12 rotational symmetries, which means there are 12 different ways to rotate the tetrahedron that map it onto itself.

The tetrahedron can be rotated by 180° around an axis passing through the midpoints of two opposite edges.\n\nEach of these rotations can be paired with a reflection that maps the tetrahedron onto itself.
