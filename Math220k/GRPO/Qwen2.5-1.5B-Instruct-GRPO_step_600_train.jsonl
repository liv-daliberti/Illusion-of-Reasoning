Find the angles of the triangle.\nassistant\n<think>\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the altitudes and the sides of a triangle. The key insight is that if two altitudes are not smaller than the sides on which they are dropped, it implies that the triangle is isosceles. This is because in an isosceles triangle, the altitude from the vertex angle to the base is equal to the length of the base, and the altitude from the base angles to the opposite sides are equal to the lengths of the legs of the triangle.\n\nGiven that two altitudes are not smaller than the sides on which they are dropped, it means that the triangle must be isosceles with two equal sides. This is because in a scalene triangle, all altitudes would be smaller than the sides on which they are dropped, as the altitude from the vertex angle to the base is not equal to the length of the base.\n\nTherefore, the triangle must be isosceles with two equal sides. The angles of an isosceles triangle can be found using the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. If we denote the angles opposite the equal sides as \\( \\alpha \\) and the vertex angle as \\( \\beta \\), then we have:\n\\[ \\alpha + \\alpha + \\beta = 180^\\circ \\]\n\\[ 2\\alpha + \\beta = 180^\\circ \\]\n\nSince the triangle is isosceles, the vertex angle \\( \\beta \\) must be less than 180 degrees, and the two base angles \\( \\alpha \\) must be equal. The only way to satisfy this equation is if \\( \\beta = 90^\\circ \\) and \\( \\alpha = 45^\\circ \\).

Inside an equilateral triangle with side $a$, there are three equal circles, each of which touches two sides of the triangle and two other circles. Find the area of the part of the triangle that is outside these circles.\nassistant\n<think>\nTo find the area of the part of the triangle that is outside the circles, we need to first determine the radius of the circles and then calculate the area of the triangle and the circles.\n</think>\n<answer>\nLet's start by finding the radius of the circles. Since the circles touch two sides of the triangle and two other circles, we can see that the radius of each circle is equal to the height of the equilateral triangle divided by 3. This is because the height of an equilateral triangle is equal to the side length multiplied by the square root of 3, and the radius of each circle is half of that height.\nThe height of the equilateral triangle is given by the formula: height = side * sqrt(3) / 2. So, the radius of each circle is: radius = (side * sqrt(3) / 2) / 3 = side * sqrt(3) / 6.\nNow, we can calculate the area of the triangle and the circles. The area of the triangle is given by the formula: area = (side * side * sqrt(3)) / 4. The area of each circle is given by the formula: area = pi * radius^2. Since there are three circles, the total area of the circles is: total_area = 3 * pi * radius^2.\nFinally, we can find the area of the part of the triangle that is outside the circles by subtracting the total area of the circles from the area of the triangle.\n</answer>", "600_correct": false, "600_changed": false}

Let's also denote the number of mushrooms each child has as \\( m \\).\n\nFrom the problem, we know that if Anya gives half of her mushrooms to Vitya, all the children will have the same number of mushrooms. This means that after giving half of her mushrooms to Vitya, Anya will have \\( \\frac{A}{2} \\) mushrooms left, and each child will have \\( m + \\frac{A}{2n} \\) mushrooms. Since this is the same for all children, we can write:\n\\[ m + \\frac{A}{2n} = m \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ \\frac{A}{2n} = 0 \\]\nThis implies that \\( A = 0 \\), which is not possible since Anya has mushrooms. Instead, we need to consider the second condition, where Anya gives all her mushrooms to Sasha, and Sasha will have as many mushrooms as all the others combined. This means that after giving all her mushrooms to Sasha, Anya will have \\( A \\) mushrooms left, and Sasha will have \\( A + m \\) mushrooms.

Then the real number $a=$ $\\qquad$\nassistant\n<think>\nTo solve this problem, we need to use the properties of arithmetic sequences and the fact that the roots of the polynomial equation are real. Let's denote the roots of the equation by $r-d$, $r$, and $r+d$, where $r$ is the middle term and $d$ is the common difference of the arithmetic sequence.\n\nGiven that the roots form an arithmetic sequence, we can express the polynomial equation in terms of its roots. The polynomial can be written as:\n\\[ (x - (r-d))(x - r)(x - (r+d)) = 0 \\]\n\nExpanding this product, we get:\n\\[ (x - r + d)(x - r)(x + r + d) = (x^2 - 2rx + r^2 + d^2)(x^2 + 2rx + r^2) \\]\n\nExpanding further, we have:\n\\[ x^4 + 2rx^3 + r^2x^2 - 2rx^3 - 4r^2x^2 - 2r^3x + r^2x^2 + 2r^3x + r^4 \\]\n\\[ = x^4 + (2r^2 - 4r^2 + r^2)x^2 + (r^4 - 2r^3)x \\]\n\\[ = x^4 - 2r^2x^2 + r^4 \\]\n\nComparing this with the given polynomial equation $x^3 + 3x^2 - x + a = 0$, we can see that the coefficient of $x^3$ must be zero, which implies that the coefficient of $x^2$ in the expanded form must be zero. Therefore, we have:\n\\[ -2r^2 = 3 \\]\n\\[ r^2 = -\\frac{3}{2} \\]\n\nSince $r^2$ cannot be negative, this implies that the roots of the polynomial cannot form an arithmetic sequence with real roots. However, if we consider the possibility of complex roots, we can use the fact that the sum of the roots of a cubic equation is equal to the negation of the coefficient of $x^2$ divided by the leading coefficient. In this case, the sum of the roots is $-3$.\n\nGiven that the roots are complex conjugates, we can write the roots as $r - di$ and $r + di$, where $d$ is the imaginary part. The sum of the roots is:\n\\[ (r - di) + (r + di) + (r + di) = 3r = -3 \\]\n\\[ r = -1 \\]\n\nNow, we can find the value of $a$ by substituting $r = -1$ into the original polynomial equation:\n\\[ (-1)^3 + 3(-1)^2 - (-1) + a = 0 \\]\n\\[ -1 + 3 + 1 + a = 0 \\]\n\\[ 3 + a = 0 \\]\n\\[ a = -3 \\]\n\nTherefore, the real number $a$ is $-3$.\n</think>\n<answer>\n\\[ a = -3 \\]\n</answer>", "600_correct": true, "600_changed": false}

Therefore, we can simply substitute $x=-3$ into the function to find the limit:\n$$\\lim_{x \\rightarrow -3} f(x) = (-3)^{3}-5(-3)^{2}+2(-3)+4 = -27-45-6+4 = -74$$\n2) For the function $\\varphi(t)=t \\sqrt{t^{2}-20}-\\lg \\left(t+\\sqrt{t^{2}-20}\\right)$, we can see that it is a composition of functions, and the inner function $t+\\sqrt{t^{2}-20}$ is not defined at $t=6$. Therefore, we cannot directly substitute $t=6$ into the function to find the limit. However, we can use the property of logarithms to simplify the function:\n$$\\varphi(t) = t \\sqrt{t^{2}-20}-\\lg \\left(t+\\sqrt{t^{2}-20}\\right) = \\lg \\left(\\frac{t \\sqrt{t^{2}-20}}{e^{\\lg \\left(t+\\sqrt{t^{2}-20}\\right)}}\\right)$$\nNow, we can use L'Hôpital's rule to find the limit of the function as $t$ approaches $6$:\n$$\\lim_{t \\rightarrow 6} \\varphi(t) = \\lim_{t \\rightarrow 6} \\lg \\left(\\frac{t \\sqrt{t^{2}-20}}{e^{\\lg \\left(t+\\sqrt{t^{2}-20}\\right)}}\\right) = \\lg \\left(\\frac{6 \\sqrt{6^{2}-20}}{e^{\\lg \\left(6+\\sqrt{6^{2}-20}\\right)}}\\right) = \\lg \\left(\\frac{6 \\sqrt{26}}{e^{\\lg \\left(6+\\sqrt{26}\\right)}}\\right) = \\lg \\left(\\frac{6 \\sqrt{26}}{6+\\sqrt{26}}\\right)$$\n</answer>", "600_correct": false, "600_changed": false}

Let's denote the given equation as:\n\\[ f(x f(x+y)) = y f(x) + 1 \\]\n\nFirst, let's substitute \\( y = 1 \\) into the equation:\n\\[ f(x f(x+1)) = f(x) + 1 \\]\n\nThis tells us that \\( f(x f(x+1)) \\) is a linear function of \\( f(x) \\). Now, let's try to find a specific form for \\( f \\). Suppose \\( f \\) is a constant function, i.e., \\( f(x) = c \\) for some constant \\( c \\). Substituting \\( f(x) = c \\) into the original equation, we get:\n\\[ f(x c + y) = y c + 1 \\]\nSince \\( f(x) = c \\) for all \\( x \\), we have:\n\\[ c = y c + 1 \\]\nThis implies:\n\\[ c(1 - y) = 1 \\]\nFor this to hold for all \\( y \\), the only solution is \\( c = 1 \\). Therefore, \\( f(x) = 1 \\) is a solution.\n\nNow, we need to check if there are any other possible solutions. Suppose \\( f \\) is not a constant function. Let's substitute \\( x = 1 \\) into the original equation:\n\\[ f(f(y+1)) = y f(1) + 1 \\]\nSince \\( f(1) \\) is a constant, let's denote it by \\( c \\). Then we have:\n\\[ f(f(y+1)) = y c + 1 \\]\nThis suggests that \\( f \\) might be a linear function. Let's assume \\( f(x) = kx + m \\) for some constants \\( k \\) and \\( m \\). Substituting this into the original equation, we get:\n\\[ f(x k(x+y) + m) = y (kx + m) + 1 \\]\n\\[ k(x k(x+y) + m) + m = y kx + y m + 1 \\]\n\\[ k^2 x (x+y) + km + m = y kx + y m + 1 \\]\nFor this to hold for all \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), the coefficients of \\( x \\) and the constant terms must match on both sides. This implies that \\( k = 1 \\) and \\( m = 1 \\). Therefore, \\( f(x) = x + 1 \\) is another solution.\n\nWe have found two solutions: \\( f(x) = 1 \\) and \\( f(x) = x + 1 \\).

If \\( f \\) were not injective, then there would be some \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\) such that \\( f(x_1) = f(x_2) \\).

The circle $D: x^2 + \\left(y - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = r^2$ has its center at $\\left(0, \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$ and radius $r$. The distance from the center of the circle to the vertex of the parabola is $\\frac{1}{2}$, which is less than the radius $r$ of the circle. This means that the circle is entirely above the parabola.\n\nWhen a tangent line is drawn from a point $A$ on the parabola to the circle, the points of tangency $E$ and $F$ lie on the circle. The line segment $EF$ is the chord of the circle that is perpendicular to the radius at the points of tangency. The length of $EF$ can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the radius of the circle, the distance from the center of the circle to the vertex of the parabola, and half the length of $EF$.\n\nThe area of the region $\\Omega$ is the area of the circle minus the area of the triangle formed by the points of tangency and the center of the circle. The area of the circle is $\\pi r^2$. The area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{length of } EF \\times \\frac{1}{2}$. Since the length of $EF$ is the diameter of the circle minus twice the distance from the center of the circle to the vertex of the parabola, the area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{length of } EF \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\text{length of } EF$.\n\nThe length of $EF$ is the diameter of the circle, which is $2r$. Therefore, the area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{4} \\times 2r = \\frac{1}{2}r$. The area of the region $\\Omega$ is then $\\pi r^2 - \\frac{1}{2}r$.\n\nSince $r > 0$, the area of the region $\\Omega$ is always greater than $\\frac{1}{2}r$. As $r$ increases, the area of the region $\\Omega$ increases. Therefore, the range of the area of region $\\Omega$ is $(\\frac{1}{2}r, \\infty)$.\n</answer>", "600_correct": false, "600_changed": false}

How many teams participated in the competition?

Let's break it down step by step.\n</think>\n<answer>\nLet's denote the number of teams as \\( n \\). In a round-robin tournament, each team plays against every other team exactly once. The total number of games played is given by the combination formula \\( \\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\).\n\nThe points distribution in a round-robin tournament can be analyzed as follows:\n- The winner gets 2 points.\n- The loser gets 0 points.\n- In a draw, both teams get 1 point.\n\nGiven the scores of the top 4 teams (11, 9, 7, 5 points) and the fact that the 5th place's score is different from the 4th place's score, we can infer the following:\n- The 1st place has 11 points.\n- The 2nd place has 9 points.\n- The 3rd place has 7 points.\n- The 4th place has 5 points.\n- The 5th place has a score that is different from the 4th place's score.\n\nSince the 5th place's score is different from the 4th place's score, the 5th place must have either 6 points (if the 4th place had 5 points) or 4 points (if the 4th place had 7 points). However, since the 5th place's score is different from the 4th place's score, the 5th place must have 6 points.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total score of all teams. The total score is the sum of the points of all teams. Since each game results in a total of 2 points (either 2 for a win and 0 for a loss, or 1 for each team in a draw), the total number of games played is equal to the total number of points awarded.\n\nThe total number of points awarded is the sum of the points of the top 4 teams plus the points of the 5th place:\n\\[ 11 + 9 + 7 + 5 + 6 = 38 \\]\n\nSince each game results in 2 points being awarded, the total number of games played is:\n\\[ \\frac{38}{2} = 19 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of teams is 19, and the total score of all the teams is 38.\n</answer>", "600_correct": false, "600_changed": false}

The equation becomes:\n\\[ f(1 + f(y)) = f(1) + y. \\]\n\nThis tells us that \\( f \\) is surjective because for any \\( y \\in \\mathbf{N}^{*} \\), there exists \\( z = 1 + f(y) \\) such that \\( f(z) = f(1) + y \\). Therefore, \\( f \\) maps every natural number to a natural number.\n\nNext, let's consider the injectivity of \\( f \\). Suppose \\( f(a) = f(b) \\). Then, for any \\( x \\in \\mathbf{N}^{*} \\), we have:\n\\[ f(x + f(a)) = f(x) + a \\]\nand\n\\[ f(x + f(b)) = f(x) + b. \\]\nSince \\( f(a) = f(b) \\), it follows that:\n\\[ f(x + f(a)) = f(x + f(b)). \\]\nThis implies \\( f(x) + a = f(x) + b \\), which means \\( a = b \\).

Since \\( k \\neq 0 \\) (because \\( f \\) maps natural numbers to natural numbers), we must have \\( k = 1 \\).

Let's break this down step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Trace Condition:**\n   The trace of a matrix \\( A = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\) is given by \\( a + d \\). We are given that the trace is 1, so \\( a + d = 1 \\).\n\n2. **Understanding the Determinant Condition:**\n   The determinant of \\( A \\) is given by \\( ad - bc \\). We are given that the determinant is 0, so \\( ad = bc \\).\n\n3. **Matrix Representation:**\n   We can represent the matrix \\( A \\) as \\( \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & 1-a \\end{pmatrix} \\) because \\( a + d = 1 \\) implies \\( d = 1 - a \\).\n\n4. **Determinant Condition:**\n   Substituting \\( d = 1 - a \\) into the determinant condition, we get \\( a(1 - a) = bc \\). This simplifies to \\( a - a^2 = bc \\).\n\n5. **Counting the Matrices:**\n   We need to count the number of distinct matrices that satisfy both conditions. Let's consider the possible values for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) (since \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are elements of \\( F \\) with \\( p \\) elements).\n\n   - For each fixed \\( a \\), \\( b \\) can take any value in \\( F \\) because \\( a + d = 1 \\) and \\( d = 1 - a \\), so \\( b \\) can be any element of \\( F \\).\n   - For each fixed \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), \\( c \\) can be any element of \\( F \\) because \\( a - a^2 = bc \\).\n\n6. **Counting the Matrices:**\n   Since \\( a \\) can take any value in \\( F \\) (there are \\( p \\) elements), and for each \\( a \\), \\( b \\) can take any value in \\( F \\) (there are \\( p \\) elements), and for each \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), \\( c \\) can take any value in \\( F \\) (there are \\( p \\) elements), the total number of matrices is \\( p \\times p \\times p = p^3 \\).\n\nTherefore, the number of matrices in \\( S \\) is \\( p^3 \\).\n\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe number of matrices in \\( S \\) is \\( p^3 \\).\n</answer>", "600_correct": false, "600_changed": false}

Let's start by understanding the relationship between the cube and the pyramid.\n\nGiven that the cube is inscribed in the pyramid, the vertices of the cube's upper base lie on the lateral edges of the pyramid, and the vertices of the cube's lower base are in the plane of the pyramid's base. This configuration implies that the cube is oriented such that its edges are parallel to the edges of the pyramid.\n\nThe key to solving this problem is to determine the relationship between the side length of the cube and the dimensions of the pyramid. Let's denote the side length of the cube as \\( s \\). The height of the pyramid can be denoted as \\( h \\), and the lateral edge of the pyramid is denoted as \\( l \\).\n\nSince the cube is inscribed in the pyramid, the height of the pyramid can be expressed in terms of the side length of the cube and the angle \\(\\alpha\\) that the lateral edge makes with the base plane. The height of the pyramid can be written as:\n\\[ h = l \\sin \\alpha \\]\n\nThe volume of the pyramid is given by:\n\\[ V_{\\text{pyramid}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{Base Area} \\times \\text{Height} \\]\nFor a regular quadrilateral pyramid, the base area is:\n\\[ \\text{Base Area} = a^2 \\]\nwhere \\( a \\) is the side length of the base of the pyramid. The height of the pyramid is \\( h = l \\sin \\alpha \\).\n\nThe volume of the cube is:\n\\[ V_{\\text{cube}} = s^3 \\]\n\nThe ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the pyramid is:\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{V_{\\text{cube}}}{V_{\\text{pyramid}}} = \\frac{s^3}{\\frac{1}{3} \\times a^2 \\times l \\sin \\alpha} = \\frac{3s^3}{a^2 l \\sin \\alpha} \\]\n\nSince the cube is inscribed in the pyramid, the side length \\( s \\) of the cube is related to the side length \\( a \\) of the base of the pyramid. The exact relationship depends on the specific geometry of the pyramid, but the ratio of the volumes can be simplified to:\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{3}{a^2 \\sin \\alpha} \\]\n\nHowever, without the specific side length of the base of the pyramid, we cannot simplify this further.

We need to show that for any sequence \\( a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{3n} \\) satisfying the conditions, the inequality holds with \\( k_n = 27 n^2 \\).\n\nConsider the case when \\( a_i = i \\) for \\( i = 1, 2, \\ldots, 3n \\). Then:\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^{3n} a_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{3n} i = \\frac{3n(3n+1)}{2}\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i a_{n+i} a_{2n+i} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} i (n+i) (2n+i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} i (n+i) (2n+i)\n\\]\nWe need to show that:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{3n(3n+1)}{2} \\right)^3 \\geq 27 n^2 \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} i (n+i) (2n+i) \\right)\n\\]\nThis inequality holds because the left-hand side grows much faster than the right-hand side as \\( n \\) increases. Therefore, the best possible value of \\( k_n \\) is indeed \\( 27 n^2 \\).\n\nThus, the best possible value of \\( k_n \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{27 n^2}\n\\]\n</think>\n<answer>\n\\[\n\\boxed{27 n^2}\n\\]\n</answer>", "600_correct": true, "600_changed": false}

Let's denote \\(y = 7x^2 - 5x + 1\\). Then the equation becomes:\n\\[5x - 7x^2 + 8\\sqrt{y} = 8.\\]\nRearranging terms, we get:\n\\[8\\sqrt{y} = 7x^2 - 5x + 8.\\]\nNext, we square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\\[(8\\sqrt{y})^2 = (7x^2 - 5x + 8)^2.\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[64y = (7x^2 - 5x + 8)^2.\\]\nSubstituting back \\(y = 7x^2 - 5x + 1\\), we get:\n\\[64(7x^2 - 5x + 1) = (7x^2 - 5x + 8)^2.\\]\nExpanding both sides, we have:\n\\[448x^2 - 320x + 64 = 49x^4 - 70x^3 + 112x^2 - 80x + 64.\\]\nRearranging all terms to one side, we get:\n\\[49x^4 - 70x^3 + 112x^2 - 320x + 64x - 64 + 64 = 0,\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[49x^4 - 70x^3 + 112x^2 - 256x = 0.\\]\nFactoring out \\(x\\), we get:\n\\[x(49x^3 - 70x^2 + 112x - 256) = 0.\\]\nThis gives us one solution \\(x = 0\\). To find the other solutions, we need to solve the cubic equation:\n\\[49x^3 - 70x^2 + 112x - 256 = 0.\\]\nWe can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. Testing \\(x = 1\\), we get:\n\\[49(1)^3 - 70(1)^2 + 112(1) - 256 = 49 - 70 + 112 - 256 = -185 \\neq 0.\\]\nTesting \\(x = 2\\), we get:\n\\[49(2)^3 - 70(2)^2 + 112(2) - 256 = 49(8) - 70(4) + 112(2) - 256 = 392 - 280 + 224 - 256 = 168 \\neq 0.\\]\nTesting \\(x = 4\\), we get:\n\\[49(4)^3 - 70(4)^2 + 112(4) - 256 = 49(64) - 70(16) + 112(4) - 256 = 3136 - 1120 + 448 - 256 = 2192 \\neq 0.\\]\nTesting \\(x = 8\\), we get:\n\\[49(8)^3 - 70(8", "600_correct": true, "600_changed": false}

On how many arrays is this possible?\nassistant\n<think>\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the properties of the operations and how they affect the array modulo 2013. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Operations:**\n   - Operation 1: Subtract 1 from each entry in a chosen row.\n   - Operation 2: Add 1 to each entry in a chosen column.\n\n2. **Modulo Operation:**\n   - We are working modulo 2013, so any number \\( n \\) can be reduced to \\( n \\mod 2013 \\).\n\n3. **Effect of Operations on Modulo:**\n   - Subtracting 1 from each entry in a row will reduce the value of each entry by 1 modulo 2013.\n   - Adding 1 to each entry in a column will increase the value of each entry by 1 modulo 2013.\n\n4. **Initial and Final States:**\n   - Initially, each entry in the array is between 1 and 2013, inclusive.\n   - After applying the operations, we want all entries to be divisible by 2013.\n\n5. **Parity Consideration:**\n   - The parity (odd or even nature) of the entries in the array will change with each operation.\n   - Subtracting 1 from each entry in a row will change the parity of each entry in that row.\n   - Adding 1 to each entry in a column will change the parity of each entry in that column.\n\n6. **Final State Requirement:**\n   - For all entries to be divisible by 2013, each entry must be even.\n   - This means that the parity of each entry must be even.\n\n7. **Parity Analysis:**\n   - Initially, each entry is either odd or even.\n   - Subtracting 1 from each entry in a row will change the parity of each entry in that row.\n   - Adding 1 to each entry in a column will change the parity of each entry in that column.\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   - For all entries to be even, the number of odd entries must be even.\n   - Since there are 2013 entries in the array, the number of odd entries must be even.\n\n9. **Counting the Possible Arrays:**\n   - The total number of possible arrays is \\( 2013^{2013} \\).\n   - Half of these arrays will have an even number of odd entries (since the parity of each entry is independent and can be either odd or even).\n\nTherefore, the number of arrays where all integers are divisible by 2013 is \\( \\frac{2013^{2013}}{2} \\).\n\n</think>\n<answer>\n\\(\\frac{2013^{2013}}{2}\\)\n</answer>", "600_correct": false, "600_changed": false}
