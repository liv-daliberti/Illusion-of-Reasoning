Find the angles of the triangle.\nassistant\n<think>\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the altitudes and the sides of a triangle. The key insight is that if two altitudes are not smaller than the sides on which they are dropped, it implies that the triangle is isosceles. This is because in an isosceles triangle, the altitude from the vertex angle to the base is equal to the length of the base, and the altitude from the base angles to the opposite sides are equal to the lengths of the legs of the triangle.\n\nGiven that two altitudes are not smaller than the sides on which they are dropped, it means that the triangle must be isosceles with two equal sides. This is because in a scalene triangle, all altitudes would be smaller than the sides on which they are dropped, as the altitude from the vertex angle to the base is not equal to the length of the base.\n\nTherefore, the triangle must be isosceles with two equal sides. The angles of an isosceles triangle can be found using the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. If we denote the angles opposite the equal sides as \\( \\alpha \\) and the vertex angle as \\( \\beta \\), then we have:\n\\[ \\alpha + \\alpha + \\beta = 180^\\circ \\]\n\\[ 2\\alpha + \\beta = 180^\\circ \\]\n\nSince the triangle is isosceles, the vertex angle \\( \\beta \\) must be less than 180 degrees, and the two base angles \\( \\alpha \\) must be equal. The only way to satisfy this equation is if \\( \\beta = 90^\\circ \\) and \\( \\alpha = 45^\\circ \\).

Inside an equilateral triangle with side $a$, there are three equal circles, each of which touches two sides of the triangle and two other circles. Find the area of the part of the triangle that is outside these circles.\nassistant\n<think>\nTo find the area of the part of the triangle that is outside the circles, we need to first determine the radius of the circles and then calculate the area of the triangle and the circles.\n</think>\n<answer>\nLet's start by finding the radius of the circles. Since the circles touch two sides of the triangle and two other circles, we can see that the radius of each circle is equal to the height of the equilateral triangle divided by 3. This is because the height of an equilateral triangle is equal to the side length multiplied by the square root of 3, and the radius of each circle is half of that height.\nThe height of the equilateral triangle is given by the formula: height = side * sqrt(3) / 2. So, the radius of each circle is: radius = (side * sqrt(3) / 2) / 3 = side * sqrt(3) / 6.\nNow, we can calculate the area of the triangle and the circles. The area of the triangle is given by the formula: area = (side * side * sqrt(3)) / 4. The area of each circle is given by the formula: area = pi * radius^2. Since there are three circles, the total area of the circles is: total_area = 3 * pi * radius^2.\nFinally, we can find the area of the part of the triangle that is outside the circles by subtracting the total area of the circles from the area of the triangle.\n</answer>", "600_correct": false, "600_changed": false}

Let's also denote the number of mushrooms each child has as \\( m \\).\n\nFrom the problem, we know that if Anya gives half of her mushrooms to Vitya, all the children will have the same number of mushrooms. This means that after giving half of her mushrooms to Vitya, Anya will have \\( \\frac{A}{2} \\) mushrooms left, and each child will have \\( m + \\frac{A}{2n} \\) mushrooms. Since this is the same for all children, we can write:\n\\[ m + \\frac{A}{2n} = m \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ \\frac{A}{2n} = 0 \\]\nThis implies that \\( A = 0 \\), which is not possible since Anya has mushrooms. Instead, we need to consider the second condition, where Anya gives all her mushrooms to Sasha, and Sasha will have as many mushrooms as all the others combined. This means that after giving all her mushrooms to Sasha, Anya will have \\( A \\) mushrooms left, and Sasha will have \\( A + m \\) mushrooms.

Then the real number $a=$ $\\qquad$\nassistant\n<think>\nTo solve this problem, we need to use the properties of arithmetic sequences and the fact that the roots of the polynomial equation are real. Let's denote the roots of the equation by $r-d$, $r$, and $r+d$, where $r$ is the middle term and $d$ is the common difference of the arithmetic sequence.\n\nGiven that the roots form an arithmetic sequence, we can express the polynomial equation in terms of its roots. The polynomial can be written as:\n\\[ (x - (r-d))(x - r)(x - (r+d)) = 0 \\]\n\nExpanding this product, we get:\n\\[ (x - r + d)(x - r)(x + r + d) = (x^2 - 2rx + r^2 + d^2)(x^2 + 2rx + r^2) \\]\n\nExpanding further, we have:\n\\[ x^4 + 2rx^3 + r^2x^2 - 2rx^3 - 4r^2x^2 - 2r^3x + r^2x^2 + 2r^3x + r^4 \\]\n\\[ = x^4 + (2r^2 - 4r^2 + r^2)x^2 + (r^4 - 2r^3)x \\]\n\\[ = x^4 - 2r^2x^2 + r^4 \\]\n\nComparing this with the given polynomial equation $x^3 + 3x^2 - x + a = 0$, we can see that the coefficient of $x^3$ must be zero, which implies that the coefficient of $x^2$ in the expanded form must be zero. Therefore, we have:\n\\[ -2r^2 = 3 \\]\n\\[ r^2 = -\\frac{3}{2} \\]\n\nSince $r^2$ cannot be negative, this implies that the roots of the polynomial cannot form an arithmetic sequence with real roots. However, if we consider the possibility of complex roots, we can use the fact that the sum of the roots of a cubic equation is equal to the negation of the coefficient of $x^2$ divided by the leading coefficient. In this case, the sum of the roots is $-3$.\n\nGiven that the roots are complex conjugates, we can write the roots as $r - di$ and $r + di$, where $d$ is the imaginary part. The sum of the roots is:\n\\[ (r - di) + (r + di) + (r + di) = 3r = -3 \\]\n\\[ r = -1 \\]\n\nNow, we can find the value of $a$ by substituting $r = -1$ into the original polynomial equation:\n\\[ (-1)^3 + 3(-1)^2 - (-1) + a = 0 \\]\n\\[ -1 + 3 + 1 + a = 0 \\]\n\\[ 3 + a = 0 \\]\n\\[ a = -3 \\]\n\nTherefore, the real number $a$ is $-3$.\n</think>\n<answer>\n\\[ a = -3 \\]\n</answer>", "600_correct": true, "600_changed": false}

If the function is not continuous, we may need to use other methods such as L'Hôpital's rule or factorization.\n</think>\n<answer>\n1) For the function $f(x)=x^{3}-5 x^{2}+2 x+4$, we can see that it is a polynomial function, which is continuous everywhere. Therefore, we can simply substitute $x=-3$ into the function to find the limit:\n$$\\lim_{x \\rightarrow -3} f(x) = (-3)^{3}-5(-3)^{2}+2(-3)+4 = -27-45-6+4 = -74$$\n2) For the function $\\varphi(t)=t \\sqrt{t^{2}-20}-\\lg \\left(t+\\sqrt{t^{2}-20}\\right)$, we can see that it is a composition of functions, and the inner function $t+\\sqrt{t^{2}-20}$ is not defined at $t=6$. Therefore, we cannot directly substitute $t=6$ into the function to find the limit. However, we can use the property of logarithms to simplify the function:\n$$\\varphi(t) = t \\sqrt{t^{2}-20}-\\lg \\left(t+\\sqrt{t^{2}-20}\\right) = \\lg \\left(\\frac{t \\sqrt{t^{2}-20}}{e^{\\lg \\left(t+\\sqrt{t^{2}-20}\\right)}}\\right)$$\nNow, we can use L'Hôpital's rule to find the limit of the function as $t$ approaches $6$:\n$$\\lim_{t \\rightarrow 6} \\varphi(t) = \\lim_{t \\rightarrow 6} \\lg \\left(\\frac{t \\sqrt{t^{2}-20}}{e^{\\lg \\left(t+\\sqrt{t^{2}-20}\\right)}}\\right) = \\lg \\left(\\frac{6 \\sqrt{6^{2}-20}}{e^{\\lg \\left(6+\\sqrt{6^{2}-20}\\right)}}\\right) = \\lg \\left(\\frac{6 \\sqrt{26}}{e^{\\lg \\left(6+\\sqrt{26}\\right)}}\\right) = \\lg \\left(\\frac{6 \\sqrt{26}}{6+\\sqrt{26}}\\right)$$\n</answer>", "600_correct": false, "600_changed": false}

Let's denote the given equation as:\n\\[ f(x f(x+y)) = y f(x) + 1 \\]\n\nFirst, let's substitute \\( y = 1 \\) into the equation:\n\\[ f(x f(x+1)) = f(x) + 1 \\]\n\nThis tells us that \\( f(x f(x+1)) \\) is a linear function of \\( f(x) \\). Now, let's try to find a specific form for \\( f \\). Suppose \\( f \\) is a constant function, i.e., \\( f(x) = c \\) for some constant \\( c \\). Substituting \\( f(x) = c \\) into the original equation, we get:\n\\[ f(x c + y) = y c + 1 \\]\nSince \\( f(x) = c \\) for all \\( x \\), we have:\n\\[ c = y c + 1 \\]\nThis implies:\n\\[ c(1 - y) = 1 \\]\nFor this to hold for all \\( y \\), the only solution is \\( c = 1 \\). Therefore, \\( f(x) = 1 \\) is a solution.\n\nNow, we need to check if there are any other possible solutions. Suppose \\( f \\) is not a constant function. Let's substitute \\( x = 1 \\) into the original equation:\n\\[ f(f(y+1)) = y f(1) + 1 \\]\nSince \\( f(1) \\) is a constant, let's denote it by \\( c \\). Then we have:\n\\[ f(f(y+1)) = y c + 1 \\]\nThis suggests that \\( f \\) might be a linear function. Let's assume \\( f(x) = kx + m \\) for some constants \\( k \\) and \\( m \\). Substituting this into the original equation, we get:\n\\[ f(x k(x+y) + m) = y (kx + m) + 1 \\]\n\\[ k(x k(x+y) + m) + m = y kx + y m + 1 \\]\n\\[ k^2 x (x+y) + km + m = y kx + y m + 1 \\]\nFor this to hold for all \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), the coefficients of \\( x \\) and the constant terms must match on both sides. This implies that \\( k = 1 \\) and \\( m = 1 \\). Therefore, \\( f(x) = x + 1 \\) is another solution.\n\nWe have found two solutions: \\( f(x) = 1 \\) and \\( f(x) = x + 1 \\). To confirm that these are the only solutions, we can use the injectivity of \\( f \\). If \\( f \\) were not injective, then there would be some \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\) such that \\( f(x_1) = f(x_2) \\).

The circle $D: x^2 + \\left(y - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = r^2$ has its center at $\\left(0, \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$ and radius $r$. The distance from the center of the circle to the vertex of the parabola is $\\frac{1}{2}$, which is less than the radius $r$ of the circle. This means that the circle is entirely above the parabola.\n\nWhen a tangent line is drawn from a point $A$ on the parabola to the circle, the points of tangency $E$ and $F$ lie on the circle. The line segment $EF$ is the chord of the circle that is perpendicular to the radius at the points of tangency. The length of $EF$ can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the radius of the circle, the distance from the center of the circle to the vertex of the parabola, and half the length of $EF$.\n\nThe area of the region $\\Omega$ is the area of the circle minus the area of the triangle formed by the points of tangency and the center of the circle. The area of the circle is $\\pi r^2$. The area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{length of } EF \\times \\frac{1}{2}$. Since the length of $EF$ is the diameter of the circle minus twice the distance from the center of the circle to the vertex of the parabola, the area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{length of } EF \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\text{length of } EF$.\n\nThe length of $EF$ is the diameter of the circle, which is $2r$. Therefore, the area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{4} \\times 2r = \\frac{1}{2}r$. The area of the region $\\Omega$ is then $\\pi r^2 - \\frac{1}{2}r$.\n\nSince $r > 0$, the area of the region $\\Omega$ is always greater than $\\frac{1}{2}r$. As $r$ increases, the area of the region $\\Omega$ increases. Therefore, the range of the area of region $\\Omega$ is $(\\frac{1}{2}r, \\infty)$.\n</answer>", "600_correct": false, "600_changed": false}

How many teams participated in the competition?

Let's break it down step by step.\n</think>\n<answer>\nLet's denote the number of teams as \\( n \\). In a round-robin tournament, each team plays against every other team exactly once. The total number of games played is given by the combination formula \\( \\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\).\n\nThe points distribution in a round-robin tournament can be analyzed as follows:\n- The winner gets 2 points.\n- The loser gets 0 points.\n- In a draw, both teams get 1 point.\n\nGiven the scores of the top 4 teams (11, 9, 7, 5 points) and the fact that the 5th place's score is different from the 4th place's score, we can infer the following:\n- The 1st place has 11 points.\n- The 2nd place has 9 points.\n- The 3rd place has 7 points.\n- The 4th place has 5 points.\n- The 5th place has a score that is different from the 4th place's score.\n\nSince the 5th place's score is different from the 4th place's score, the 5th place must have either 6 points (if the 4th place had 5 points) or 4 points (if the 4th place had 7 points). However, since the 5th place's score is different from the 4th place's score, the 5th place must have 6 points.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total score of all teams. The total score is the sum of the points of all teams. Since each game results in a total of 2 points (either 2 for a win and 0 for a loss, or 1 for each team in a draw), the total number of games played is equal to the total number of points awarded.\n\nThe total number of points awarded is the sum of the points of the top 4 teams plus the points of the 5th place:\n\\[ 11 + 9 + 7 + 5 + 6 = 38 \\]\n\nSince each game results in 2 points being awarded, the total number of games played is:\n\\[ \\frac{38}{2} = 19 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of teams is 19, and the total score of all the teams is 38.\n</answer>", "600_correct": false, "600_changed": false}

The equation becomes:\n\\[ f(1 + f(y)) = f(1) + y. \\]\n\nThis tells us that \\( f \\) is surjective because for any \\( y \\in \\mathbf{N}^{*} \\), there exists \\( z = 1 + f(y) \\) such that \\( f(z) = f(1) + y \\). Therefore, \\( f \\) maps every natural number to a natural number.\n\nNext, let's consider the injectivity of \\( f \\). Suppose \\( f(a) = f(b) \\). Then, for any \\( x \\in \\mathbf{N}^{*} \\), we have:\n\\[ f(x + f(a)) = f(x) + a \\]\nand\n\\[ f(x + f(b)) = f(x) + b. \\]\nSince \\( f(a) = f(b) \\), it follows that:\n\\[ f(x + f(a)) = f(x + f(b)). \\]\nThis implies \\( f(x) + a = f(x) + b \\), which means \\( a = b \\).

Since \\( k \\neq 0 \\) (because \\( f \\) maps natural numbers to natural numbers), we must have \\( k = 1 \\).

Let's break this down step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Trace Condition:**\n   The trace of a matrix \\( A = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\) is given by \\( a + d \\). We are given that the trace is 1, so \\( a + d = 1 \\).\n\n2. **Understanding the Determinant Condition:**\n   The determinant of \\( A \\) is given by \\( ad - bc \\). We are given that the determinant is 0, so \\( ad = bc \\).\n\n3. **Matrix Representation:**\n   We can represent the matrix \\( A \\) as \\( \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & 1-a \\end{pmatrix} \\) because \\( a + d = 1 \\) implies \\( d = 1 - a \\).\n\n4. **Determinant Condition:**\n   Substituting \\( d = 1 - a \\) into the determinant condition, we get \\( a(1 - a) = bc \\). This simplifies to \\( a - a^2 = bc \\).\n\n5. **Counting the Matrices:**\n   We need to count the number of distinct matrices that satisfy both conditions. Let's consider the possible values for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) (since \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are elements of \\( F \\) with \\( p \\) elements).\n\n   - For each fixed \\( a \\), \\( b \\) can take any value in \\( F \\) because \\( a + d = 1 \\) and \\( d = 1 - a \\), so \\( b \\) can be any element of \\( F \\).\n   - For each fixed \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), \\( c \\) can be any element of \\( F \\) because \\( a - a^2 = bc \\).\n\n6. **Counting the Matrices:**\n   Since \\( a \\) can take any value in \\( F \\) (there are \\( p \\) elements), and for each \\( a \\), \\( b \\) can take any value in \\( F \\) (there are \\( p \\) elements), and for each \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), \\( c \\) can take any value in \\( F \\) (there are \\( p \\) elements), the total number of matrices is \\( p \\times p \\times p = p^3 \\).\n\nTherefore, the number of matrices in \\( S \\) is \\( p^3 \\).\n\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe number of matrices in \\( S \\) is \\( p^3 \\).\n</answer>", "600_correct": false, "600_changed": false}

Let's start by understanding the relationship between the cube and the pyramid.\n\nGiven that the cube is inscribed in the pyramid, the vertices of the cube's upper base lie on the lateral edges of the pyramid, and the vertices of the cube's lower base are in the plane of the pyramid's base. This configuration implies that the cube is oriented such that its edges are parallel to the edges of the pyramid.\n\nThe key to solving this problem is to determine the relationship between the side length of the cube and the dimensions of the pyramid. Let's denote the side length of the cube as \\( s \\). The height of the pyramid can be denoted as \\( h \\), and the lateral edge of the pyramid is denoted as \\( l \\).\n\nSince the cube is inscribed in the pyramid, the height of the pyramid can be expressed in terms of the side length of the cube and the angle \\(\\alpha\\) that the lateral edge makes with the base plane. The height of the pyramid can be written as:\n\\[ h = l \\sin \\alpha \\]\n\nThe volume of the pyramid is given by:\n\\[ V_{\\text{pyramid}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{Base Area} \\times \\text{Height} \\]\nFor a regular quadrilateral pyramid, the base area is:\n\\[ \\text{Base Area} = a^2 \\]\nwhere \\( a \\) is the side length of the base of the pyramid. The height of the pyramid is \\( h = l \\sin \\alpha \\).\n\nThe volume of the cube is:\n\\[ V_{\\text{cube}} = s^3 \\]\n\nThe ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the pyramid is:\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{V_{\\text{cube}}}{V_{\\text{pyramid}}} = \\frac{s^3}{\\frac{1}{3} \\times a^2 \\times l \\sin \\alpha} = \\frac{3s^3}{a^2 l \\sin \\alpha} \\]\n\nSince the cube is inscribed in the pyramid, the side length \\( s \\) of the cube is related to the side length \\( a \\) of the base of the pyramid. The exact relationship depends on the specific geometry of the pyramid, but the ratio of the volumes can be simplified to:\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{3}{a^2 \\sin \\alpha} \\]\n\nHowever, without the specific side length of the base of the pyramid, we cannot simplify this further.

Compute the sum of all values of $P(\\tfrac13)$ over all nonconstant polynomials $P$ satisfying the above constraint for this $c$.\nassistant\n<think>\nTo solve this problem, we need to analyze the given functional equation \\(P(z^2) = P(z-c)P(z+c)\\) and determine the largest possible value of \\(c\\). We will then compute the sum of all values of \\(P\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\) for all nonconstant polynomials \\(P\\) satisfying this constraint.\n</think>\n<answer>\nLet's start by considering the functional equation \\(P(z^2) = P(z-c)P(z+c)\\). This equation suggests that the polynomial \\(P\\) must have a specific form. One way to approach this is to consider the roots of \\(P\\). If \\(P\\) has a root \\(r\\), then \\(P(r) = 0\\). Substituting \\(z = r\\) into the functional equation, we get \\(P(r^2) = P(r-c)P(r+c)\\). Since \\(P(r) = 0\\), this implies that \\(P(r^2) = 0\\). Therefore, \\(r^2\\) must be a root of \\(P\\).\n\nNow, let's consider the polynomial \\(P(z)\\) and its roots. If \\(P(z)\\) has a root \\(r\\), then \\(P(z)\\) must be divisible by \\((z-r)\\). This means that \\(P(z)\\) can be written as \\(P(z) = (z-r)^k Q(z)\\) for some integer \\(k\\) and some polynomial \\(Q(z)\\).\n\nNext, we need to determine the largest possible value of \\(c\\).

We need to find \\( n \\) such that the nested radical expression is rational.\n\n1. **Initial Observation**: For the expression to be rational, the innermost term must be rational. Let's denote the innermost term by \\( a_1 \\), the next term by \\( a_2 \\), and so on. We need \\( a_1 \\) to be rational.\n\n2. **Innermost Term**: The innermost term is \\( \\sqrt{\\sigma(1)} \\). For this to be rational, \\( \\sigma(1) \\) must be a perfect square. The smallest perfect square is 1, so \\( \\sigma(1) = 1 \\).\n\n3. **Next Term**: The next term is \\( \\sqrt{\\sigma(2)} \\). For this to be rational, \\( \\sigma(2) \\) must be a perfect square. The smallest perfect square greater than 1 is 4, so \\( \\sigma(2) = 4 \\).\n\n4. **Next Term**: The next term is \\( \\sqrt{\\sigma(3)} \\). For this to be rational, \\( \\sigma(3) \\) must be a perfect square. The smallest perfect square greater than 4 is 9, so \\( \\sigma(3) = 9 \\).\n\n5. **General Pattern**: We can see a pattern forming. The terms \\( \\sigma(1), \\sigma(2), \\sigma(3), \\ldots \\) must be the first \\( n \\) perfect squares in some order. The smallest \\( n \\) for which this is possible is \\( n = 3 \\). For \\( n = 3 \\), the permutation could be \\( \\sigma = (1, 4, 9) \\).\n\n6. **Verification**: For \\( n = 3 \\), the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{1 + \\sqrt{4 + \\sqrt{9}}} = \\sqrt{1 + \\sqrt{4 + 3}} = \\sqrt{1 + \\sqrt{7}}\n\\]\n\nSince \\( \\sqrt{7} \\) is irrational, \\( \\sqrt{1 + \\sqrt{7}} \\) is also irrational. Therefore, \\( n = 3 \\) does not work.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: We need to check if there is any \\( n > 3 \\) that works. For \\( n > 3 \\), the terms \\( \\sigma(1), \\sigma(2), \\ldots, \\sigma(n) \\) must be the first \\( n \\) perfect squares in some order. However, the nested radical expression will always involve irrational terms because the sum of irrational numbers will be irrational. Therefore, no \\( n > 3 \\) will make the expression rational.\n\nThus, the only natural number \\( n \\) for which there exists a permutation \\(\\sigma\\) of the numbers \\(1, 2, \\ldots, n\\) such that the number\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\sigma(1) + \\sqrt{\\sigma(2) + \\sqrt{\\cdots + \\sqrt{\\sigma(n)}}}}\n\\]\n\nis rational is \\( n = 3 \\).\n\nThe answer is \\( \\boxed{3} \\).\n</answer>", "600_correct": false, "600_changed": false}

The number of perfect squares less than or equal to \\( n \\) is \\( \\lfloor \\sqrt{n} \\rfloor \\).

The key condition is that the sum $S_k = a_1 - a_2 + a_3 - a_4 + \\cdots + (-1)^{k+1}a_k$ is a multiple of $k$ for all positive integers $k$. This implies that $S_k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{k}$.\n\nLet's analyze the first few terms of the sequence to identify a pattern:\n- For $k=1$, $S_1 = a_1 = 2021^{2021}$, which is clearly a multiple of 1.\n- For $k=2$, $S_2 = a_1 - a_2 = 2021^{2021} - a_2$. Since $0 \\le a_2 < 2$, $a_2$ can be 0 or 1. If $a_2 = 0$, then $S_2 = 2021^{2021}$, which is a multiple of 2. If $a_2 = 1$, then $S_2 = 2021^{2021} - 1$, which is not a multiple of 2. However, since $2021$ is odd, $2021^{2021}$ is odd, and thus $2021^{2021} - 1$ is even, making $S_2$ a multiple of 2. Therefore, $a_2$ must be 0 to satisfy the condition for $k=2$.\n\nContinuing this pattern, we see that $a_2 = 0$ and $a_3 = 1$ to satisfy the condition for $k=3$. This pattern suggests that $a_k = (-1)^{k+1}$ for $k \\ge 2$.\n\nNow, we need to determine the value of $a_1$. Since $a_1 = 2021^{2021}$ and $a_1$ must be a multiple of 1, it is already a multiple of 1. Therefore, $a_1 = 2021^{2021}$.\n\nTo find $a_{2021^{2022}}$, we note that $2021^{2022}$ is a very large number, and the sequence alternates between 1 and -1 starting from $a_2$. Since $2021^{2022}$ is even, $a_{2021^{2022}} = 1$.\n\nThus, the $2021^{2022}$th term of the sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ is $1$.\n</think>\n<answer>\n$1$\n</answer>", "600_correct": false, "600_changed": false}

Let's rewrite the inequality as:\n\\[x^2 - (a+1)x - a^2 > 0.\\]\nThis can be factored as:\n\\[(x - a)(x + a) > 0.\\]\nWe need to determine the values of \\(x\\) that satisfy this inequality for all \\(a \\in (1, 2)\\).\n\nFirst, let's consider the critical points where the expression \\((x - a)(x + a)\\) changes sign. These points are \\(x = a\\) and \\(x = -a\\). Since \\(a \\in (1, 2)\\), we have \\(-a \\in (-2, -1)\\).\n\nTo ensure the inequality \\((x - a)(x + a) > 0\\) holds for all \\(a \\in (1, 2)\\), we need to check the intervals determined by these critical points. The critical points divide the real line into three intervals: \\((-\\infty, -a)\\), \\((-a, a)\\), and \\((a, \\infty)\\).\n\nWe need to check the sign of \\((x - a)(x + a)\\) in each of these intervals:\n1. For \\(x < -a\\), both \\(x - a\\) and \\(x + a\\) are negative, so \\((x - a)(x + a) > 0\\).\n2. For \\(-a < x < a\\), \\(x - a\\) is negative and \\(x + a\\) is positive, so \\((x - a)(x + a) < 0\\).\n3. For \\(x > a\\), both \\(x - a\\) and \\(x + a\\) are positive, so \\((x - a)(x + a) > 0\\).\n\nFrom this analysis, we see that \\((x - a)(x + a) > 0\\) for \\(x < -a\\) or \\(x > a\\). Since \\(-a \\in (-2, -1)\\), we need to find the range of \\(x\\) such that \\(x < -a\\) or \\(x > a\\) for all \\(a \\in (1, 2)\\).\n\nThe most restrictive condition is \\(x > a\\) for all \\(a \\in (1, 2)\\). Therefore, \\(x\\) must be greater than the maximum value of \\(a\\) in the interval \\((1, 2)\\), which is 2. So, \\(x > 2\\).\n\nThus, the range of \\(x\\) is:\n\\[x > 2.\\]\n</think>\n<answer>\n\\[x > 2.\\]\n</answer>", "600_correct": false, "600_changed": false}

Marco's move involves choosing a black cell with more than two white neighbors and turning it white, while turning all its neighbors black. Vera's move involves swapping the colors of two neighboring cells. To ensure Vera can win, we need to find the minimal $k$ such that Vera can guarantee a win, and then find the smallest $t$ such that Vera can guarantee a win in at most $t$ turns for any given $k$.\n\nFirst, let's consider the minimal $k$ value. If $k=1$, Vera can swap the colors of two neighboring cells, but this doesn't necessarily block Marco's moves. However, if $k=2$, Vera can swap the colors of two neighboring cells, and this can be used to block Marco's moves. Specifically, if Marco chooses a black cell with more than two white neighbors, Vera can swap the colors of two neighboring cells, turning one of them white and the other black, effectively blocking Marco's move.\n\nNow, let's consider the smallest $t$ such that Vera can guarantee a win in at most $t$ turns for any given $k$. If $k=2$, Vera can guarantee a win in at most 2 turns. This is because Vera can swap the colors of two neighboring cells, and this can be used to block Marco's moves. If $k>2$, Vera can still guarantee a win in at most 2 turns, as she can swap the colors of two neighboring cells to block Marco's moves.\n\nTherefore, the minimal $k$ value is $k=2$, and the smallest $t$ value is $t=2$.

Let's start by understanding the configuration and the properties of the orthocenters.\n\n1. **Equilateral Triangle Properties**: Since ABC is an equilateral triangle, all its internal angles are 60 degrees. The orthocenter of an equilateral triangle is also its centroid, circumcenter, and incenter, which means it is the same point.\n\n2. **Orthocenters R and S**: The orthocenter of a triangle is the point where the altitudes intersect. For an equilateral triangle, the orthocenter, circumcenter, and centroid coincide at the same point, which is the center of the triangle.\n\n3. **Lines BP and CQ**: These lines intersect at point T. We need to find the angle BCQ such that the triangle RST is equilateral.\n\n4. **Angle BCQ**: Since R and S are the same point (the orthocenter), the triangle RST is essentially a triangle formed by the intersection of the altitudes of the equilateral triangle ABC. The key is to understand the symmetry and the properties of the equilateral triangle.\n\n5. **Symmetry and Equilateral Triangle**: In an equilateral triangle, the angle bisectors, altitudes, and medians are all the same. This symmetry implies that the angles formed by the intersection of these lines will be symmetric as well.\n\n6. **Possible Values for Angle BCQ**: Given the symmetry and the properties of the equilateral triangle, the angle BCQ must be such that the triangle RST is equilateral. This means that the angle BCQ must be 60 degrees, as this is the only angle that allows the triangle RST to be equilateral.\n\nTherefore, the only possible value for angle BCQ such that RST is equilateral is 60 degrees.\n</think>\n<answer>\n60 degrees\n</answer>", "600_correct": false, "600_changed": false}

The pairs of factors of 15 are $(1, 15)$, $(3, 5)$, and $(5, 3)$. Since $U$ and $T$ are different letters, we can eliminate $(1, 15)$ and $(5, 3)$ because they would not allow for distinct values for $U$ and $T$.

However, this is not possible since $E$ must be a digit from 1 to 6.

Let's analyze the angles around the point where the three line segments intersect.\n\n1. The angles around the point sum up to 360 degrees.\n2. We can see that one of the angles is 120 degrees, and another is 100 degrees.\n3. The remaining angle, which is $x$, can be found by subtracting the sum of the other two angles from 360 degrees.\n\nSo, $x = 360 - 120 - 100 = 140$ degrees.\n\nHowever, this doesn't match any of the given options.

The key is to ensure that the marked cells do not interfere with the placement of the dominoes, which must cover all cells without overlapping.\n\nFirst, let's consider the total number of cells on the board, which is $4n^2$. Each domino covers 2 cells, so the total number of dominoes needed to cover the entire board is $2n^2$. However, we need to ensure that the marked cells do not interfere with the placement of these dominoes.\n\nTo achieve this, we can use a checkerboard coloring argument. Color the cells of the board in a checkerboard pattern, where each cell is either black or white. In a $2n \\times 2n$ board, there will be $n^2$ black cells and $n^2$ white cells. If we mark $k$ cells such that $k$ is odd, we can always find a unique way to partition the board into dominoes because the marked cells will not disrupt the alternating pattern of the checkerboard.\n\nTo see why, consider that if $k$ is odd, we can always find a way to place the dominoes such that each domino covers a black and a white cell. This is because the checkerboard pattern ensures that every domino must cover one black and one white cell. If $k$ were even, it would be impossible to place the dominoes without violating the checkerboard pattern.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $k$ that satisfies the condition is $k = 1$.\n\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe smallest positive integer $k$ with the given property is $k = 1$. This is because if we mark just one cell, we can always find a unique way to partition the board into $1 \\times 2$ and $2 \\times 1$ dominoes, as the marked cell will not interfere with the placement of the dominoes in the checkerboard pattern.\n</answer>", "600_correct": false, "600_changed": false}

A table of values of a known function $f(n)$ for natural values of $n$ has been compiled; it turned out that the second difference is constantly equal to zero. By what formula can $f(n)$ be represented for any natural $n$? How does the situation stand for fractional values of $n$?\nassistant\n<think>\nTo determine the formula for the function \\( f(n) \\) given that the second difference is constantly equal to zero, we need to analyze the properties of the function. The second difference being zero implies that the function is a quadratic function. This is because the second difference of a quadratic function is a constant, and the second difference of a linear function is zero, but the second difference of a quadratic function is a constant.\n\nA general quadratic function can be written as:\n\\[ f(n) = an^2 + bn + c \\]\nwhere \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are constants.\n\nTo find the constants \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\), we need to use the given table of values. However, since the table is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\). But we know that the function must be quadratic.\n\nFor fractional values of \\( n \\), the function \\( f(n) \\) will still be quadratic because the second difference is zero, and the second difference of a quadratic function is a constant. Therefore, the situation for fractional values of \\( n \\) is the same as for natural values of \\( n \\).\n\nThe formula for \\( f(n) \\) is:\n\\[ f(n) = an^2 + bn + c \\]\nwhere \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are constants determined by the given table of values.\n\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe function \\( f(n) \\) can be represented by the quadratic formula:\n\\[ f(n) = an^2 + bn + c \\]\nwhere \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are constants determined by the given table of values.

This is because the function \\( y = x^2 - x \\) is a parabola that opens upwards, and the function \\( y = \\cos(10\\pi x) \\) is a cosine function that oscillates between -1 and 1. The cosine function is periodic with a period of \\( \\frac{2\\pi}{10\\pi} = \\frac{1}{5} \\), and within each period, the cosine function intersects the parabola exactly once. Since \\( x \\geq 0 \\), we are only considering the positive part of the cosine function, which means we are looking at the first half of each period. Therefore, within each period, the cosine function intersects the parabola exactly once, and since the cosine function is periodic, there is exactly one intersection point per period. Given that the cosine function is periodic with a period of \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\), and considering the positive \\( x \\)-values, there is exactly one intersection point for each period, and since the cosine function is symmetric and periodic, there is exactly one intersection point in the interval \\( x \\geq 0 \\).\n</answer>", "600_correct": false, "600_changed": false}
