Let's start by examining the sequence and its recursive definition.\n\nThe sequence is defined as follows:\n- $a_1 = 1$\n- $a_{2n} = a_n$\n- $a_{2n+1} = a_n + 1$\n\nWe need to find all positive integers $n$ such that $a_{kn} = a_n$ for all integers $1 \\leq k \\leq n$.\n\nTo approach this, let's consider the properties of the sequence and how it behaves under different values of $k$.\n\nFirst, let's look at the base case:\n- $a_1 = 1$\n\nNow, let's consider $a_2$:\n- $a_2 = a_1 = 1$\n\nNext, let's consider $a_3$:\n- $a_3 = a_1 + 1 = 2$\n\nNow, let's consider $a_4$:\n- $a_4 = a_2 = 1$\n\nWe can see a pattern emerging. For $a_{kn}$ to be equal to $a_n$, we need to ensure that the sequence does not change its value when multiplied by $k$. This means that $a_n$ must be a fixed point of the sequence.\n\nTo prove this, let's assume that $a_n = a_{kn}$ for all $1 \\leq k \\leq n$. Then, we need to show that this assumption holds for all $n$.\n\nWe can use induction to prove this. Let's assume that $a_n = a_{kn}$ for some $n$. Then, we need to show that $a_{kn} = a_{k(n+1)}$.\n\nUsing the recursive definition, we have:\n- $a_{kn} = a_n$\n- $a_{k(n+1)} = a_{kn} + 1$\n\nSince $a_n = a_{kn}$, we can substitute this into the equation:\n- $a_{k(n+1)} = a_n + 1$\n\nThis shows that $a_{kn} = a_{k(n+1)}$, which means that the assumption holds for all $n$.\n\nTherefore, the only positive integers $n$ such that $a_{kn} = a_n$ for all integers $1 \\leq k \\leq n$ are the powers of 2.\n\nNow, let's move on to part (b).\n\nTo prove that there exist infinitely many positive integers $m$ such that $a_{km} \\geq a_m$ for all positive integers $k$, we need to show that the sequence is non-decreasing.\n\nWe can use the recursive definition to show that $a_{kn} \\geq a_n$ for all $1 \\leq k \\leq n$.\n\nUsing the recursive definition, we have:\n- $a_{kn} = a_n$\n- $a_{k(n+1)} = a_{kn} + 1$\n\nSince $a_n \\geq a_{kn}$, we can substitute this into the equation:\n- $a_{k(n+1)} = a_n + 1 \\geq a_n$\n\nThis shows that $a_{kn} \\geq a_n$ for all $1 \\leq k \\leq n$.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is non-decreasing, and there exist infinitely many positive integers $m$ such that $a_{km} \\geq a_m$ for all positive integers $k$.\n</think>\n<answer>\na) The only positive integers $n$ such that $a_{kn} = a_n$ for all integers $1 \\leq k \\leq n$ are the powers of 2.\n\nb) There exist infinitely many positive integers $m$ such that $a_{km} \\geq a_m$ for all positive integers $k$.\n</answer>", "500_correct": false, "500_changed": true}

Find the angles of the triangle.\nassistant\n<think>\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the altitudes and the sides of a triangle. The key insight is that if two altitudes are not smaller than the sides on which they are dropped, it implies that the triangle is isosceles. This is because in an isosceles triangle, the altitude from the vertex angle to the base is equal to the length of the base, and the altitude from the base angles to the opposite sides are equal to the lengths of the legs of the triangle.\n\nGiven that two altitudes are not smaller than the sides on which they are dropped, we can deduce that the triangle must be isosceles. Let's denote the angles of the triangle as \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\), with \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) being the base angles and \\(C\\) being the vertex angle.\n\nSince the triangle is isosceles, we have \\(A = B\\).

Let's consider the function \\(2y = \\sin \\alpha - y \\cos \\alpha\\).\n\nTo find the maximum and minimum values of \\(y\\), we can use calculus or analyze the function's behavior. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the maximum value of \\(\\sin \\alpha\\) is 1 and the minimum value of \\(\\cos \\alpha\\) is -1. This gives us:\n\\[ 2y = 1 - (-y) \\implies 2y = 1 + y \\implies y = 1. \\]\n\nTo find the minimum value, we consider the case when \\(\\cos \\alpha\\) is maximized and \\(\\sin \\alpha\\) is minimized.

By substituting \\(y = \\frac{1}{2}\\) back into the original function, we find that it satisfies the equation.

Inside an equilateral triangle with side $a$, there are three equal circles, each of which touches two sides of the triangle and two other circles. Find the area of the part of the triangle that is outside these circles.\nassistant\n<think>\nTo find the area of the part of the triangle that is outside the circles, we first need to determine the radius of the circles and then calculate the area of the triangle and the circles.\n</think>\n<answer>\nLet's start by finding the radius of the circles. Since the circles touch two sides of the triangle and two other circles, we can see that the radius of each circle is equal to the height of the equilateral triangle divided by 3. This is because the height of an equilateral triangle is 2 times the radius of the inscribed circle.\n\nThe height of an equilateral triangle with side length $a$ is given by $h = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}a$. Therefore, the radius of each circle is $\\frac{h}{3} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{6}a$.\n\nNow, let's calculate the area of the triangle. The area of an equilateral triangle with side length $a$ is given by $A = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}a^2$.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the area of the three circles. Since each circle has a radius of $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{6}a$, the area of one circle is $\\pi r^2 = \\pi \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{6}a\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\pi}{12}a^2$. Therefore, the total area of the three circles is $3 \\times \\frac{\\pi}{12}a^2 = \\frac{\\pi}{4}a^2$.\n\nFinally, we can find the area of the part of the triangle that is outside the circles by subtracting the area of the circles from the area of the triangle. The area of the part of the triangle that is outside the circles is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}a^2 - \\frac{\\pi}{4}a^2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3} - \\pi}{4}a^2$.\n</answer>", "500_correct": false, "500_changed": false}

If Anya gives half of her mushrooms to Vitya, all the children will have the same number of mushrooms, and if instead Anya gives all her mushrooms to Sasha, Sasha will have as many mushrooms as all the others combined. How many children went to pick mushrooms\nassistant\n<think>\nLet's denote the number of children as \\( n \\) and the number of mushrooms Anya has as \\( A \\). Let's also denote the number of mushrooms each child has as \\( m \\).\n\nFrom the problem, we know that if Anya gives half of her mushrooms to Vitya, all the children will have the same number of mushrooms. This means that after giving half of her mushrooms to Vitya, Anya will have \\( \\frac{A}{2} \\) mushrooms left, and each child will have \\( m + \\frac{A}{2n} \\) mushrooms. Since this is the same for all children, we can write:\n\\[ m + \\frac{A}{2n} = m \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ \\frac{A}{2n} = 0 \\]\nThis implies that \\( A = 0 \\), which is not possible since Anya has mushrooms. Instead, we need to consider the second condition, where Anya gives all her mushrooms to Sasha, and Sasha will have as many mushrooms as all the others combined. This means that after giving all her mushrooms to Sasha, Anya will have \\( A - m \\) mushrooms left, and Sasha will have \\( A \\) mushrooms. The remaining \\( n-1 \\) children will have \\( m \\) mushrooms each. So, we can write:\n\\[ A - m = (n-1)m \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ A = (n-1)m + m \\]\n\\[ A = nm \\]\nNow, we need to find a value of \\( n \\) that satisfies this equation. Since \\( A \\) is the number of mushrooms Anya has, and it must be a positive integer, we can test small values of \\( n \\) to find a solution. Let's try \\( n = 3 \\):\n\\[ A = 3m \\]\nThis means Anya has 3 times as many mushrooms as each child. If Anya gives half of her mushrooms to Vitya, she will have \\( \\frac{3m}{2} \\) mushrooms left, and each child will have \\( m + \\frac{3m}{2n} = m + \\frac{3m}{6} = m + \\frac{m}{2} = \\frac{3m}{2} \\) mushrooms. This is the same as the number of mushrooms each child has after Anya gives all her mushrooms to Sasha, who will have \\( 3m \\) mushrooms.

This is because the sum of the roots of a cubic equation $ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0$ is given by $-\\frac{b}{a}$, and for our equation, $a = 1$, so the sum of the roots is $-3$.\n\nGiven that the roots form an arithmetic sequence, we can write the sum of the roots as:\n\\[ (r-d) + r + (r+d) = 3r = -3 \\]\n\\[ r = -1 \\]\n\nNow, we know that the roots are $-1-d$, $-1$, and $-1+d$. We can substitute these roots into the original equation to find the value of $a$.\n\nSubstituting $x = -1$ into the equation, we get:\n\\[ (-1)^3 + 3(-1)^2 - (-1) + a = 0 \\]\n\\[ -1 + 3 + 1 + a = 0 \\]\n\\[ 3 + a = 0 \\]\n\\[ a = -3 \\]\n\nTherefore, the value of $a$ is $-3$.\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe value of $a$ is $-3$.\n</answer>", "500_correct": true, "500_changed": false}

The equation becomes:\n\\[ f(1 + f(y)) = f(1) + y. \\]\n\nThis tells us that \\( f \\) is surjective because for any \\( y \\in \\mathbf{N}^{*} \\), there exists \\( z = 1 + f(y) \\) such that \\( f(z) = f(1) + y \\). Therefore, \\( f \\) maps every natural number to a natural number.\n\nNext, let's consider the injectivity of \\( f \\). Suppose \\( f(a) = f(b) \\). Then for any \\( x \\in \\mathbf{N}^{*} \\), we have:\n\\[ f(x + f(a)) = f(x) + a \\]\nand\n\\[ f(x + f(b)) = f(x) + b. \\]\nSince \\( f(a) = f(b) \\), it follows that:\n\\[ f(x + f(a)) = f(x + f(b)). \\]\nThis implies \\( f(x) + a = f(x) + b \\), which means \\( a = b \\). Therefore, \\( f \\) is injective.\n\nSince \\( f \\) is both surjective and injective, it is bijective. Let's denote \\( f(1) = c \\). Then the equation becomes:\n\\[ f(x + c) = f(x) + y. \\]\nThis suggests that \\( f \\) is a linear function. Let's assume \\( f(x) = kx + d \\) for some constants \\( k \\) and \\( d \\). Substituting this into the original equation, we get:\n\\[ f(x + f(y)) = f(x + ky + d) = k(x + ky + d) + d = kx + k^2y + kd + d. \\]\nOn the other hand, we have:\n\\[ f(x) + y = kx + d + y. \\]\nEquating the two expressions, we get:\n\\[ kx + k^2y + kd + d = kx + y + d. \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ k^2y = y. \\]\nSince \\( y \\neq 0 \\), we must have \\( k^2 = 1 \\), so \\( k = 1 \\) or \\( k = -1 \\).\n\nIf \\( k = 1 \\), then \\( f(x) = x + d \\).

Therefore, \\( f(x) = x \\) is a solution.\n\nIf \\( k = -1 \\), then \\( f(x) = -x + d \\).

The key is to recognize that the process stops either when all 3 red chips are drawn or when both green chips are drawn. We need to calculate the probability of each scenario and then sum them up.\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe probability that the 3 reds are drawn can be calculated by considering the different ways the chips can be drawn until either all 3 reds are drawn or both green chips are drawn. We can use the concept of conditional probability and the law of total probability to find the desired probability.\n\nLet's denote the events as follows:\n- $R_1$: The first red chip is drawn.\n- $R_2$: The second red chip is drawn.\n- $R_3$: The third red chip is drawn.\n- $G_1$: The first green chip is drawn.\n- $G_2$: The second green chip is drawn.\n\nThe probability that the 3 reds are drawn can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of the following scenarios:\n1. The first red chip is drawn, and then the second red chip is drawn, and then the third red chip is drawn.\n2. The first red chip is drawn, and then the second red chip is drawn, and then the third red chip is drawn, and then the second green chip is drawn.\n3. The first red chip is drawn, and then the second red chip is drawn, and then the third red chip is drawn, and then the second green chip is drawn, and then the third green chip is drawn.\n\nWe can use the following probabilities:\n- $P(R_1) = \\frac{3}{5}$\n- $P(R_2 | R_1) = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n- $P(R_3 | R_1 \\cap R_2) = \\frac{1}{3}$\n- $P(G_1 | R_1 \\cap R_2 \\cap R_3) = \\frac{2}{3}$\n- $P(G_2 | R_1 \\cap R_2 \\cap R_3 \\cap G_1) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nNow, we can calculate the total probability as follows:\n\\[ P(\\text{3 reds}) = P(R_1) \\cdot P(R_2 | R_1) \\cdot P(R_3 | R_1 \\cap R_2) \\cdot P(G_1 | R_1 \\cap R_2 \\cap R_3) \\cdot P(G_2 | R_1 \\cap R_2 \\cap R_3 \\cap G_1) \\]\n\n\\[ P(\\text{3 reds}) = \\frac{3}{5} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ P(\\text{3 reds}) = \\frac{3 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1}{5 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2} \\]\n\n\\[ P(\\text{3 reds}) = \\frac{6}{180} \\]\n\n\\[ P(\\text{3 reds}) = \\frac{1}{30} \\]\n\nHowever, this calculation seems to be incorrect based on the given options. Let's re-evaluate the problem using a different approach.\n\nThe correct approach involves considering the total number of ways to draw the chips and the number of favorable outcomes where the 3 reds are drawn.

This function represents the greatest integer less than or equal to $\\frac{x}{n!}$.\n\nThe key insight is that the sum of the floor functions will be maximized when $x$ is just slightly more than a multiple of $10!$ (since $10!$ is the largest factorial in the sum). This is because each term $\\left[\\frac{x}{n!}\\right]$ will be close to $x$ when $x$ is just above a multiple of $n!$.\n\nGiven that the sum of the floor functions equals 1001, we can infer that $x$ is just above a multiple of $10!$ but not too far. Specifically, $x$ should be close to $10! + 1001$ because the sum of the floor functions will be close to 1001.\n\nLet's calculate $10!$:\n\\[10! = 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 3628800\\]\n\nSo, $x$ should be close to:\n\\[x = 10! + 1001 = 3628800 + 1001 = 3638801\\]\n\nNow, we need to check if $x = 3638801$ satisfies the equation. We can do this by calculating the sum of the floor functions:\n\\[\\left[\\frac{3638801}{1!}\\right] + \\left[\\frac{3638801}{2!}\\right] + \\cdots + \\left[\\frac{3638801}{10!}\\right]\\]\n\nSince $3638801$ is just above $10!$, all terms $\\left[\\frac{3638801}{n!}\\right]$ will be equal to $3638801$ for $n = 1, 2, \\ldots, 10$. Therefore, the sum is:\n\\[3638801 + 3638801 + \\cdots + 3638801 = 10 \\times 3638801 = 36388010\\]\n\nThis is not equal to 1001, so $x = 3638801$ is not the solution. We need to find the correct $x$ that satisfies the equation. Since the sum of the floor functions is 1001, $x$ must be slightly less than $10! + 1001$ but close to it. The correct value of $x$ is:\n\\[x = 10! + 1001 - 1 = 3628800 + 1000 = 3629800\\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the sum of the floor functions for $x = 3629800$:\n\\[\\left[\\frac{3629800}{1!}\\right] + \\left[\\frac{3629800}{2!}\\right] + \\cdots + \\left[\\frac{3629800}{10!}\\right]\\]\n\nSince $3629800$ is just above $10!$, all terms $\\left[\\frac{3629800}{n!}\\right]$ will be equal to $3629800$ for $n = 1, 2, \\ldots,", "500_correct": false, "500_changed": false}

Find the ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the pyramid, if the lateral edge of the pyramid makes an angle $\\alpha$ with the base plane.\nassistant\n<think>\nTo find the ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the pyramid, we need to consider the geometric properties of the pyramid and the cube. Let's start by understanding the relationship between the cube and the pyramid.\n\nGiven that the cube is inscribed in the pyramid, the vertices of the cube's upper base lie on the lateral edges of the pyramid, and the vertices of the cube's lower base are in the plane of the pyramid's base. This configuration implies that the cube is oriented such that its edges are parallel to the edges of the pyramid.\n\nThe key to solving this problem is to determine the relationship between the side length of the cube and the dimensions of the pyramid. Let's denote the side length of the cube as \\( s \\) and the height of the pyramid as \\( h \\).\n\nSince the cube is inscribed in the pyramid, the height of the pyramid can be expressed in terms of the side length of the cube and the angle \\(\\alpha\\) that the lateral edge makes with the base plane. The height of the pyramid can be written as \\( h = s \\cot \\alpha \\).\n\nThe volume of the cube is given by \\( V_{\\text{cube}} = s^3 \\).\n\nThe volume of the pyramid is given by \\( V_{\\text{pyramid}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{Base Area} \\times \\text{Height} \\). Since the base of the pyramid is a square with side length \\( s \\), the base area is \\( s^2 \\). Therefore, the volume of the pyramid is \\( V_{\\text{pyramid}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times s^2 \\times s \\cot \\alpha = \\frac{1}{3} s^3 \\cot \\alpha \\).\n\nThe ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the pyramid is then:\n\\[\n\\frac{V_{\\text{cube}}}{V_{\\text{pyramid}}} = \\frac{s^3}{\\frac{1}{3} s^3 \\cot \\alpha} = \\frac{3}{\\cot \\alpha} = 3 \\tan \\alpha\n\\]\n\nThus, the ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the pyramid is \\( 3 \\tan \\alpha \\).\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the pyramid is \\( 3 \\tan \\alpha \\).\n</answer>", "500_correct": false, "500_changed": false}

Let's denote the angles of the triangle as $A$, $B$, and $C$, where $A + B + C = \\pi$.\n\nGiven that $A$, $B$, and $C$ are interior angles of a triangle, we know that $0 < A, B, C < \\pi$. Also, since $A + B + C = \\pi$, we have $B + C = \\pi - A$.\n\nNow, let's consider the expression $\\cos A(\\sin B + \\sin C)$. We can rewrite this as $\\cos A \\sin B + \\cos A \\sin C$.\n\nTo find the minimum value, we can use the fact that $\\sin B + \\sin C = 2 \\sin \\left(\\frac{B+C}{2}\\right) \\cos \\left(\\frac{B-C}{2}\\right)$.

Since $A$ is an angle in a triangle, $0 < A < \\pi$, and thus $0 < \\cos A \\leq 1$.\n\nThe minimum value of $\\cos A$ is $0$, which occurs when $A = \\pi$. However, since $A$ is an angle in a triangle, the minimum value of $\\cos A$ is actually $0$ when $A = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, which is not possible in a triangle. Therefore, we need to consider the next smallest value for $\\cos A$, which is $1$.\n\nWhen $\\cos A = 1$, the expression becomes $2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot \\cos \\left(\\frac{A}{2}\\right) \\cos \\left(\\frac{B-C}{2}\\right) = 2 \\cos \\left(\\frac{A}{2}\\right) \\cos \\left(\\frac{B-C}{2}\\right)$.\n\nThe minimum value of $\\cos \\left(\\frac{A}{2}\\right)$ is $0$, which occurs when $A = \\pi$.

On how many arrays is this possible?\nassistant\n<think>\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the properties of the operations and the constraints given. The operations allow us to adjust the values in the array by either subtracting 1 from each entry in a row or adding 1 to each entry in a column. We need to determine if it's possible to transform the array so that all entries are divisible by 2013.\n\nFirst, let's consider the parity (odd or even nature) of the entries in the array. Each operation either decreases or increases the parity of the entries in the chosen row or column. Since we start with all entries being between 1 and 2013, which are all odd, we need to determine if it's possible to make all entries even.\n\nThe key insight here is that the parity of the entries in the array will remain invariant under the given operations. This is because subtracting 1 from each entry in a row or adding 1 to each entry in a column will change the parity of the entries in the chosen row or column, but it will not change the overall parity of the array. Therefore, if we start with all entries being odd, they will remain odd after any number of operations.\n\nSince 2013 is an odd number, it is not possible to make all entries in the array divisible by 2013, because 2013 is odd and cannot be divided by an odd number to produce an even number. Therefore, it is impossible to transform the array so that all integers are divisible by 2013.\n\nThus, the number of arrays that are possible is 0.\n</think>\n<answer>\n0\n</answer>", "500_correct": false, "500_changed": false}

Calculate the total distance Andrea has already traveled.\n2. Determine the remaining distance she needs to travel.\n3. Calculate the average distance she needs to travel per day for the remaining days of the trip.\n\nFirst, we calculate the distance Andrea has already traveled. Since she has completed $\\frac{3}{7}$ of the trip's total distance of $168 \\mathrm{~km}$, we can find this distance by multiplying $168 \\mathrm{~km}$ by $\\frac{3}{7}$:\n\\[ \\text{Distance traveled} = 168 \\times \\frac{3}{7} = 6 \\times 3 = 18 \\mathrm{~km} \\]\n\nNext, we find the remaining distance she needs to travel. This is the total distance minus the distance she has already traveled:\n\\[ \\text{Remaining distance} = 168 - 18 = 150 \\mathrm{~km} \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how many days are left in the trip. Since Andrea has already completed 3 days of the 6-day trip, the number of days left is:\n\\[ \\text{Days left} = 6 - 3 = 3 \\mathrm{~days} \\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the average distance she needs to travel per day for the remaining days of the trip:\n\\[ \\text{Average distance per day} = \\frac{150 \\mathrm{~km}}{3 \\mathrm{~days}} = 50 \\mathrm{~km/day} \\]\n\nHowever, this calculation seems to have a mistake. Let's recheck the steps:\n\nThe correct calculation for the remaining distance is:\n\\[ \\text{Remaining distance} = 168 - 18 = 150 \\mathrm{~km} \\]\n\nThe correct calculation for the average distance per day for the remaining days is:\n\\[ \\text{Average distance per day} = \\frac{150 \\mathrm{~km}}{3 \\mathrm{~days}} = 50 \\mathrm{~km/day} \\]\n\nBut the options provided are different. Let's recheck the options and the problem statement.

Specifically, we need to use the fact that the derivative of a polynomial can have at most as many roots as the polynomial itself, but with a different multiplicity.\n\nGiven that $P(x^2)$ has $2n+1$ roots, we need to determine the smallest number of roots that $P(x)$ can have. Let's denote the roots of $P(x)$ by $r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_m$. When we substitute $x^2$ for $x$ in $P(x)$, we get $P(x^2)$. The roots of $P(x^2)$ are the values of $x$ such that $x^2 = r_i$ for some root $r_i$ of $P(x)$. This means that each root $r_i$ of $P(x)$ contributes two roots to $P(x^2)$, namely $\\sqrt{r_i}$ and $-\\sqrt{r_i}$.\n\nSince $P(x^2)$ has $2n+1$ roots, and each root of $P(x)$ contributes two roots to $P(x^2)$, the total number of roots of $P(x)$ must be $2n+1$. This is because each root of $P(x)$ is counted twice in the roots of $P(x^2)$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of roots that the derivative of the polynomial $P(x)$ can have is $2n+1$.\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe smallest number of roots that the derivative of the polynomial $P(x)$ can have is $2n+1$.\n</answer>", "500_correct": false, "500_changed": false}

To find the maximum value, we can take the derivative of $f(x)$ and set it to zero to find the critical points.

However, since the problem asks for the fraction to be irreducible, we can assume that the GCD of 64 and $35x$ is 1, which means that the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\nFor part b), we need to prove that $n = 3^{23} + 5^{", "500_correct": false, "500_changed": false}

The only way this can happen is if \\( 2^{n-8} = 1 \\), which gives us \\( n-8 = 0 \\), so \\( n = 8 \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct value of \\( n \\) is \\( 8 \\).\n</answer>", "500_correct": false, "500_changed": false}

Let's subtract $2x + 2y$ from both sides of the inequality:\n\\[xy + 3 - 2x - 2y \\ge 0\\]\n\nNow, let's rearrange the terms to group $x$ and $y$ together:\n\\[xy - 2x - 2y + 3 \\ge 0\\]\n\nNext, we can factor the left side of the inequality:\n\\[(x - 2)(y - 2) \\ge 0\\]\n\nThis inequality tells us that the product of $(x - 2)$ and $(y - 2)$ is non-negative.

The mean is the sum of all weights divided by the number of children. The weights are 106 pounds, 5 pounds, 5 pounds, 6 pounds, and 8 pounds. The sum of these weights is 106 + 5 + 5 + 6 + 8 = 130 pounds. Since there are 5 children, the mean weight is 130 / 5 = 26 pounds.\n\nNext, let's calculate the median.

The equation is:\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{a_n t^n}{n!} = \\left(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{2^n t^n}{n!}\\right)^2 \\cdot \\left(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{3^n t^n}{n!}\\right)^2\n\\]\n\nFirst, let's consider the series on the right side. Each series is a binomial expansion:\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{2^n t^n}{n!} = (1 + 2t)^n\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{3^n t^n}{n!} = (1 + 3t)^n\n\\]\n\nSo, the right side of the equation becomes:\n\\[\n\\left((1 + 2t)^n\\right)^2 \\cdot \\left((1 + 3t)^n\\right)^2 = \\left((1 + 2t)^n (1 + 3t)^n\\right)^2\n\\]\n\nNow, let's consider the left side of the equation. The left side is a series where each term is $\\frac{a_n t^n}{n!}$. To find $a_n$, we need to compare the coefficients of $t^n$ on both sides of the equation.\n\nThe left side can be written as:\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{a_n t^n}{n!}\n\\]\n\nThe right side can be written as:\n\\[\n\\left((1 + 2t)^n (1 + 3t)^n\\right)^2 = \\left((1 + 2t + 3t + 6t^2)^n\\right)^2 = \\left((1 + 5t + 6t^2)^n\\right)^2\n\\]\n\nTo find $a_n$, we need to expand the right side and compare the coefficients of $t^n$ on both sides. However, this is a complex task and typically requires advanced techniques in combinatorics and generating functions.\n\nGiven the complexity, let's consider a simpler approach. If we assume that $a_n = 0$ for all $n \\neq 0$, then the left side of the equation would be:\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{a_n t^n}{n!} = \\frac{a_0 t^0}{0!} = a_0\n\\]\n\nThe right side of the equation would be:\n\\[\n\\left((1 +", "500_correct": false, "500_changed": false}

The sum of the ages of the mother, father, and the two youngest daughters is 88 years.\n2. The sum of the ages of the two youngest daughters and the mother is 31 years less than the age of the father.\n3.

Since \\(p, q, r\\) are primes, they can either be odd or even. If any of them were even, the product \\((p+1)(q+2)(r+3)\\) would be even, but the right-hand side \\(4pqr\\) is even, so this would imply that at least one of \\(p, q, r\\) is even, which is not possible since all primes are odd. Therefore, all three primes must be odd.\n\nNext, let's consider the equation modulo 3.

We start with the smallest odd primes: 3, 5, and 7.\n\nTesting \\(p = 3\\):\n\\[\n(3+1)(q+2)(r+3) = 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot r \\implies 4(q+2)(r+3) = 12r \\implies (q+2)(r+3) = 3r.\n\\]\nThis equation must hold for some primes \\(q\\) and \\(r\\).

So, \\(q = 5\\) does not work.\n\nTesting \\(p = 5\\):\n\\[\n(5+1)(q+2)(r+3) = 4 \\cdot 5 \\cdot r \\implies 6(q+2)(r+3) = 20r \\implies (q+2)(r+3) = \\frac{10r}{3}.\n\\]\nThis equation must hold for some primes \\(q\\) and \\(r\\). Let's try \\(q = 7\\):\n\\[\n(7+2)(r+3) = \\frac{10r}{3} \\implies 9(r+3) = \\frac{10r}{3} \\implies 27(r+3) = 10r \\implies 27r + 81 = 10r \\implies 17r = -81,\n\\]\nwhich is not possible since \\(r\\) must be a prime.

Let's denote the length of the segment \\(O_1O_2\\) as \\(d\\). The larger circle has a radius of 6 cm, and the smaller circle has a radius of 4 cm. The secant intersects the segment \\(O_1O_2\\) at point \\(T\\) and divides it in the ratio \\(1:2\\). This means that \\(AT = 1\\) cm and \\(BT = 2\\) cm, so \\(AB = 3\\) cm.\n\nSince \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are points of intersection of the smaller and larger circles with the segment \\(O_1O_2\\), we can use the power of a point theorem. The power of point \\(T\\) with respect to both circles is the same because \\(T\\) lies on the secant. The power of point \\(T\\) with respect to the larger circle is \\(TA \\cdot TB = 1 \\cdot 2 = 2\\) cm², and with respect to the smaller circle is \\(OA \\cdot OB = 4 \\cdot 4 = 16\\) cm².\n\nSince \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are points of intersection, the power of point \\(T\\) with respect to both circles is the same, so we have:\n\\[TA \\cdot TB = OA \\cdot OB = 2 = 16.\\]\nThis is a contradiction, so we need to consider the correct interpretation of the problem. The correct interpretation is that the length of the segment \\(O_1O_2\\) is the sum of the radii of the two circles plus the length of the segment \\(AB\\), which is 3 cm.

Determine the smallest positive integer $k$ with the following property: it is possible to mark $k$ cells on a $2 n \\times 2 n$ board so that there exists a unique partition of the board into $1 \\times 2$ and $2 \\times 1$ dominoes, none of which contains two marked cells.\nassistant\n<think>\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand the constraints and the properties of the dominoes and the board. A $1 \\times 2$ domino covers two adjacent cells, and a $2 \\times 1$ domino covers two cells that are not adjacent. The key is to ensure that the marked cells do not form any pairs that would allow the dominoes to be partitioned uniquely.\n\nFirst, let's consider the total number of cells on the board, which is $4n^2$. Since each domino covers 2 cells, the total number of dominoes needed to cover the entire board is $2n^2$. However, we need to ensure that the marked cells do not form any pairs that would allow the dominoes to be partitioned uniquely.\n\nTo achieve this, we can mark the cells in a checkerboard pattern, but with a twist. Instead of marking every other cell, we can mark every third cell in a checkerboard pattern. This means we mark cells at positions $(i, j)$ where $i + j$ is a multiple of 3. This ensures that no two marked cells are adjacent, and thus no two marked cells can form a pair that would allow the dominoes to be partitioned uniquely.\n\nNow, let's count the number of marked cells. In a $2n \\times 2n$ board, the number of cells at positions $(i, j)$ where $i + j$ is a multiple of 3 is $n^2$. This is because for every $i$, there are exactly $n$ values of $j$ that satisfy the condition $i + j \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $k$ with the given property is $n^2$.\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe smallest positive integer $k$ with the given property is $n^2$.\n</answer>", "500_correct": false, "500_changed": false}

A table of values of a known function $f(n)$ for natural values of $n$ has been compiled; it turned out that the second difference is constantly equal to zero. By what formula can $f(n)$ be represented for any natural $n$? How does the situation stand for fractional values of $n$?\nassistant\n<think>\nTo determine the formula for $f(n)$, we need to understand the properties of the function given that the second difference is constant. The second difference being constant implies that the function is a quadratic function. This is because the second difference of a quadratic function is a constant, and the first difference of a quadratic function is a linear function.\n\nA general quadratic function can be written as:\n\\[ f(n) = an^2 + bn + c \\]\n\nwhere $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants. To find the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$, we can use the given table of values. Let's denote the table of values as follows:\n\\[ \\begin{array}{c|c}\nn & f(n) \\\\\n\\hline\n1 & f(1) \\\\\n2 & f(2) \\\\\n3 & f(3) \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots \\\\\n\\end{array} \\]\n\nWe can use the first and second differences to find the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$. The first difference is the difference between consecutive values of $f(n)$, and the second difference is the difference between consecutive first differences.\n\nGiven that the second difference is constant, we can use the following steps to find the formula:\n1. Calculate the first differences.\n2. Calculate the second differences.\n3. Use the second differences to find the values of $a$ and $b$.\n4. Use the first differences to find the value of $c$.\n\nFor fractional values of $n$, the situation is similar. The function remains quadratic, but the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ will be different for fractional values of $n$.\n\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe function $f(n)$ can be represented as a quadratic function:\n\\[ f(n) = an^2 + bn + c \\]\n\nFor fractional values of $n$, the situation is similar, but the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ will be different for fractional values of $n$.\n</answer>", "500_correct": false, "500_changed": false}

The function $y=\\cos 10 \\pi x$ is a cosine function with a period of $\\frac{2\\pi}{10\\pi} = \\frac{1}{5}$, and it oscillates between -1 and 1.\n\nSince the cosine function oscillates between -1 and 1, and the parabola $y=x^{2}-x$ has a minimum value of $-\\frac{1}{4}$ at $x=\\frac{1}{2}$, the cosine function will intersect the parabola at most twice within each period of the cosine function.\n\nGiven that the period of the cosine function is $\\frac{1}{5}$, and considering the behavior of the cosine function, we can conclude that the functions intersect at most twice within one period of the cosine function.\n\nTo determine if there are exactly two intersections, we can analyze the derivative of the difference of the two functions to see if they are increasing or decreasing in a way that allows for exactly two intersections.\n\nThe derivative of $y=x^{2}-x$ is $y'=2x-1$, and the derivative of $y=\\cos 10 \\pi x$ is $y'=-10 \\pi \\sin 10 \\pi x$.
